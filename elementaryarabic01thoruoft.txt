<lb/>PART I.
<lb/>ORTHOGRAPHY AND ORTHOËPY.
<lb/>1. Arabic is written from right to left with twenty-eight
<lb/>letters, all consonants; three of which, however, are also used as
<lb/>vowels. In modern alphabetical order they range as follows, each
<lb/>with the equivalent employed by Wright's Arabic Grammar:
<lb/>the second equivalent (if any) is from Elementary Arabic: First
<lb/>reading book; being easier for beginners, as Dr Wright discards
<lb/>digraphs, i. e. two letters for the representation of one sound.
<pb n="3">
<lb/>REM. a. أfollowing ل forms لاlâm' alif which is sometimes
<lb/>reckoned as a letter.
<lb/>REM. e.  ي و أ are called  حُرُوفُ الْعِلَّةِthe weak letters.
<lb/>2. The orthoëpy, i.e correct pronunciation, of Arabic consonants
<lb/>is most easily acquired by learning from a Moslem to read
<lb/>the Corân alound. With the exception of minute and insignificant
<lb/>divergencies this Corânic pronunciation is in theory identical
<lb/>nearly* everywhere, though in India, and probably in countries
<lb/>still more remote from Arabia, its distinctness has fallen off, and
<lb/>still more remote letters, notabley  عand  حis lost. Further,
<lb/>the Corân's vowelling is beyond dispute; and this is of more
<lb/>advantage to beginners than they are at first capable of recognizing;
<lb/>vowel- signs exits, and are used, for purposes of grammar
<lb/>rather than to aid colloquial pronunciation. Slight indications
<lb/>only as to Corânic pronunciation can here be given, together with
<lb/>an explanation of the transliteration to be employed.
<lb/>b r f l m h are pronounced as in English, but r must be trilled and h
<lb/>distinctly uttered, however placed: thus  مَهْدِيّmahdîy one
<lb/>led aright almost mahĭdîy, and  وَجْهwajh face like wajhĭ.
<lb/>t d sharper than in English, and with the tongue's tip, to
<lb/>distinguish them from
<lb/>&tdot; &ddot; pronounced with broad of tongue, the tip being held against
<lb/>the lower teeth.
<lb/>* A Turkish 'imâm will pronounce certain letters as in Turkish; thus
<lb/>kyâmil for  كَامِلkâmil one who is perfect.
<pb n="4">
<lb/>th as in thorn, thump; but th as in goatherd, lighthouse.
<lb/>j is pronounced (i) ĵ as in John Jim Jack at al Azhar (the
<lb/>famous Cairo University), but (ii) at the mosques of
<lb/>Damascus, Tunis and Algiers &jcaron; as s in usual, measure,
<lb/>vision,and as z in azure, and j in adjoin, adjective, adjacent,
<lb/>bijou; and g in lodge, prestige, singe. The former sound is
<lb/>represented by Frenchmen with dj and by Germans with
<lb/>dsch,if now we double  جthus  سَجَّادَةٌa prayer-carpet,
<lb/>it is easy to say sa&jcaron;&jcaron; âdaħ, but not saĵĵâdaħ
<lb/>the French &jcaron; of bijou is therefore more convenient. Turks
<lb/>however pronounce this letter as ĵ, and (iii) most Egyptians
<lb/>colloquially as the g of go, which last is the sound given in
<lb/>Hebrew.
<lb/>&hdot; can only be learned by ear: beginners must use h until they
<lb/>catch the sound.
<lb/>kh has long been employed by Anglo- Indians for the final
<lb/>sound, harshly said, of lough, loch; gh being required for
<lb/>  غَيْنghain and ch wanted in Persian etc. for the final
<lb/>consonant of beach, which were best transcribed bîc, i.e
<lb/>with the Italian c in dolce: kh must sound as in blockhouse,
<lb/>thickheaded. Be it observed that  خis not a k but an h,
<lb/>which cannot in Hebrew writing be distinguished from ح 
<lb/>dh is as th in though, thee, this; being as  of nodern Greece:
<lb/>but dh as in bedhangings, adhesion.
<lb/>&zdot; is strictly th said far back: but usually as z pronounced
<lb/>with the tongue's tip pressed against the lower teeth; then
<lb/>z must be sounded sharply to make a distinction.
<lb/>s sounds as in kiss:  مُسْلِمMoslem (quasi-mosslem) is muslim
<pb n="5">
<lb/>the first syllable of which resembles that of muzzle -im
<lb/>neither in vowel nor consonant. If hissed with the tongue's
<lb/>tip s contrasts with
<lb/>ç which must be pronounced further back, and with broad of tongue.
<lb/>sh as in shore, wash; but sh as in mishap. For sh the French
<lb/>use ch and Germans sch, which last represents in Dutch
<lb/>  سخskh.
<lb/>must be learnt by ear. The arrangement of throat is the
<lb/>same as that required for &hdot; but without aspirate. To
<lb/>mimic baby camels is best of all; otherwise one must repeat
<lb/>words in which  عَيْنain occurs between two vowels, as
<lb/>  فَعَلَfa'ala, he did,  فَعَلَتْ فَعَلْتَ فَعَلْتِ فَعَلْتُetc. (see § 369,
<lb/>Table 1).
<lb/>gh is the sound o gargling; but gh as in foghorn with the Persian كَى gâf, thus كَه gh.
<lb/>q in Arabia is commonly pronounced as g in go, and so may
<lb/>be said at first; but the student will learn to harden g in
<lb/>the direction of k, and must sound
<lb/>k very sharply in contrast. No one who can recite the Corân
<lb/>like a Moslem at mosque will confuse  كand  قas do
<lb/>uninstructed Europeans..
<lb/>n as in English,  نكnk being as in sank, sink; but  نبnb
<lb/>sounds mb, thus  مِنْبَرa pulpit, called mimbar.
<lb/>w y are always consonants, as  وَزِيرwazîr burden bearer, سَوَاكِن 
<lb/>sawâkin (Souakim) female inhabitants,  يُوسُفyûsuf Joseph;
<lb/>but, as these three examples show,  ي و اare frequently
<lb/>letters of prolongation (see § 6).
<pb n="6">
<lb/>ħ representing ة and  ـةis sounded as h when final, and as
<lb/>t when followed by a vowel: it is called  تَآءٌ مَرْبُوطَةٌ tâ'
<lb/>mandû&tdot;aħ tied,as distinguished from ت t,  تَآءٌ مَمْدُودَةٌtâ'
<lb/>mandûdaħ stretched (see § 294 rem. b)
<lb/>4. The vowels and diphthongs are as follows:
<lb/>  فَتْحَةٌa as vowel sound in aunt, wan, thumb, hat.
<lb/>  كَسْرَةٌi as vowel sound in pin, bit, gift.
<lb/>  ضَمَّةٌu as vowel sound in push, bull, mustache.
<lb/>  اَâ as vowel sound in father, hard.
<lb/>  يِî as vowel sound in keep, beach, chief, seize.
<lb/>  وُû as vowel sound in moon, rule, blue, you.
<lb/>  يِai as vowel sound in aisle, my, rule, sigh, die, I.
<lb/>  وَau as vowel sound in thou, how, bough.
<lb/>  ىَa is as â.
<lb/>  ًan tanwîn of fat&hdot;ħ (see § 8).
<lb/>  ِin tanwîn of k&adiacritic;sraħ (see § 8).
<lb/>  ٌun tanwîn of &ddot;mmaħ (see § 8).
<lb/>  ىًan as an, but in pause as â (see § 27).
<lb/>  اٍa&ncirc; as an, but in pause as â (see § 27).
<lb/>REM. a. The three Arabic words above are names of the
<lb/>vowel-marks, the corresponding sounds being called كَسْرٌ فَتْحٌ and ضَمُّ 
<lb/>REM. b. A vowel is called  حَرَكَةٌa motion, its mark being
<lb/>termed  شَكْلٌform or figure, plural أَسْكَالٌ and  .شُكُولٌHence
<lb/>a consonant when followed by a vowel is said to be  مُتَحَرِكٌin motion.
<pb n="7">
<lb/>5.When the Corân is recited, each letter, whatever its
<lb/>relative position, in theory represents the same sound; but in
<lb/>practice certain consonants somewhat modify adjacent vowels,
<lb/>for instance  ق ظ ط ض صcause â, following one of them, to
<lb/>be sounded like the Scandinavian å, following one of them, to
<lb/>in nor, saw, war, hall, wrath, ought, caught. As to the many
<lb/>jargons which constitute from any book: pronunciation of each
<lb/>of these spoken dialects (they are unwritten) is easy to an
<lb/>Englishman who can read aloud the Corânic extracts of Elementary
<lb/>Arabic: First reading book uttering the consonants like a
<lb/>Moslem mosque; but it must be acquired by ear at the
<lb/>particular locality simultaneously with all eccentricities of
<lb/>vocabulary and grammar*.
<lb/>6. The long vowels â, î, û are indicated (see § 4) by marking
<lb/>the corresponding short vowels before و ا and ي respectively,
<lb/>which are then called  حُرُوفُ الْمَدِّletters of prolongation.
<lb/>REM.a. In certain common words â is indicated merely by
<lb/>fat&hdot;aħ; as  اللهُetc., which should properly be written with the
<lb/>perpendicular fat&hdot;aħ, thus اَللُّهُ God,  هرُونُAaron,  اَلرَّحْمنُthe
<lb/>merciful,  اَلسَّموَاتُthe heavens,  اَلْقِيمَةُthe resurrestion,  لكِنْbut,
<lb/>  ذلِكَthat,  هذَاthis etc.: the words  ثَلَاثٌthree,  ثَلَاثُونَthirty,
<lb/>*Attempts have been made to print the Maltese dialect of Arabic in
<lb/>Roman character at Valetta, and by the Bible Society in London, but in
<lb/>neither case does the work betray a knowledge of philology. Far more
<lb/>scholarly is the following book, which will be found most useful on the
<lb/>Lower Nile;—“The Modern Egyptian Dialect of Arabic. A Grammar, with
<lb/>Exercises, Reading-Lessons and Glossaries, from the German of Dr K. Vollers
<lb/>With numerous additions by the Author. Translated by F. C. Burkitt, M. A.,
<lb/>Trinity College. Cambridge: at the University Press, 1895.”
<pb n="8">
<lb/>  ثَمَانِيةٌeight,  ثَمَانُونَeighty and  إِسْرَئِيلُIsrael are also written
<lb/>defectively, thus ثَمنُونَ ثَمنِيةٌ ثَلقُونَ ثَلثٌ and إِسْرَائِلُ 
<lb/>7. Fat&hdot;aħ before ي and و forms the diphthongs ai and au
<lb/>(see § 4). Colloquial pronunciation however, frequently gives
<lb/>ai as ei in vein, reign, neighbour, thus شَيْخ as sheikha elder, chief,
<lb/>  بَيْتas beit house, family, verse, اِثْنَيْنِ (oblique case of اِثْنَانِ ) as
<lb/>ithnein two.
<lb/>NOTE. The vowel sound in vein were better represented by ê,
<lb/>whereas  يai should remain a diphthong as in the French
<lb/>word pays (nearly)pêî in contrast to the French letter p (nearly) pê
<lb/>REM. a. A superfluous  اis written after  وat the end of
<lb/>certain verbal forms: it is useful in manuscript to prevent the و 
<lb/>seeming separate and so being mistaken for  وَand.
<lb/>REM. b. At the end of a word  ىfollowing upon fat&hdot;aħ (i.e a
<lb/>see § 4) is pronounced as  اâ, so that  عَلَى'ala upon and  عَلَاalâ
<lb/>to be high scan the same. When in this position ا and ى are
<lb/>called  اَلْأَلِفُ الْمَقْصُورَةُthe ' alif that can be abbreviated, because
<lb/>they are shortened in pronunciation if followed by a connective
<lb/>álif (see § 18); thus  عَلَى اللهِupon God and  عَلَا اللهُGod has
<lb/>ascended are both in pause (see § 27 pronounced 'alallâh. The
<lb/>interposition of hamzaħ (see § 15) prevents this waçl union,
<lb/>thus  عَلَلآءُ الدِّينِ'alâ'u -1dîni (Aladdin) the sublimity of religion.
<lb/>The 'alif maqçûraħ, however written, is quiescent (see § 9 rem. a)
<lb/>al also are  وof  وْau and  ي of  يْai. When attached to
<lb/>tanwîn, radical final 'alif is quiescent, thus  عَصًاa stick (see
<lb/>§ 212 b); but it is also maqçûaħ in  اَلعَصَاthe stick.
<pb n="9">
<lb/>REM. c. If a pronominal suffix be added to a word ending in
<lb/>  ىas  نَرَىwe see, the  ىis sometimes retained, but more often
<lb/>is changed into  اas  نَرَاكَfor  نَرَيكَor  نَريكَ (all pronounced)
<lb/>narâka we see thee.
<lb/>REM.d. Some words ending in  اةâħ may be written وة 
<lb/>or وة as حَيَوةٌ or حَيوةٌ life,  ro صَلَوةٌ  صَلوةٌprayer, زَكَوةٌ or زَكوةٌ 
<lb/>alms: further we find ية or ية for اة in the loan word
<lb/>  تَوْرَيةٌor  تَوْريةٌOld Testament.
<lb/>8. Marks of the short vowels when doubled at the end of a
<lb/>word (see § 4) are pronounced thus ً an, ٍ in, ٌ un, which
<lb/>is called  تَنْوِينٌtanwînun adding of the letter nûn.
<lb/>REM. a. Tanwîn of fat&hdot;aħ takes ا  after all consonants except
<lb/>  ةas بَابًا quite, but سِنَةً drousiness (see § 308). When preceding
<lb/>  ىit requires no ا as هُدًى guidance. Notwithstanding this' alif,
<lb/>the vowel is short: thus bâba&ncirc; (not ân), but in pause (see § 27)
<lb/>bâbâ. We transliterate بَابًا bâba&ncirc; and سِنَةً sinaħan, but a&ncirc; and
<lb/>an are pronounced alike; except n pause, when an is not heard,
<lb/>whereas a&ncirc; sounds as â. In pause sinaħan is read sinah (see
<lb/>en&ddot; fo § 2).
<lb/>The following orthographic signs are also use:
<lb/>9. Sukûn rest  هis placed over the final consonant of all
<lb/>shut syllables (see § 25).
<lb/>REM. a. A consnant which has no following vowel is called
<lb/>  حَرْفٌ سَاكِنٌa quiescent letter (see § 4 rem. b).
<lb/>REM. b. Letters that are assimilated to a following letter,
<lb/>which receive in consequence tashdîd (see § 11), are retained
<pb n="10">
<lb/>in writing but are not marked with sukûn; thus اَللَّغَةُ the
<lb/>language,  أضرَدتُّpronounced 'arattu (see § 14 c).
<lb/>10. When part of a diphthong ي and و take sukûn, but this
<lb/>sign is very unusual over 'alif maqçûraħ (see § 7 rem. b) or
<lb/>other letter of prolongation.
<lb/>11 Tashdîd strengthening  ّis marked over a double consonant
<lb/>and the letter's repetition saved;thus  بَدَّلَbaddala to
<lb/>substitute,  اَلْكُلُّal kullu the whole.
<lb/>REM. c. Hamzaħ (see § 15) may be doubled and take tashdîd,
<lb/>thus  سَأَّالٌsa” âlun a menducant from  سَأَلَsa'ala to ask.
<lb/>14. The euphonic tashdid follows a vowelless consonant,
<lb/>which, though expressed in writing, is passed over in pronunciation, in order to
<lb/>avoid a harshness of sound, and assimilated to a following consonant. It is used:—
<lb/>(a) With the letters  ن ل ظ ط ض ص ش س ز ر ذ د ث تafter  اَلْthe (see § 345).
<lb/>REM. a. These letters are called  اَلْحُرُوفُ الشَّمسِشَّةُthe solar
<lb/>letters because  شَمْسٌsun begins with one of them, and for an
<lb/>analogous reason all other consonants are called اَلْحُرُوفُ الْقَمَرِيَّةُ 
<lb/>the lunar letters from  قَمَرٌmoon.
<lb/>(b) With the letters  ي و م ل رafter n with sukûn, as
<lb/>  مِن رَّبِّهِfrom his Lord,  كِتَابٌ مُّبِينٌa perspicuous book, which
<lb/>are read mirrabbihi, kitâbummubînun. The n of the words
<lb/>  أَنْ عَنْ مِنْis often not written when they are combined with مَنْ مَا or لَا 
<pb n="11">
<lb/>REM. b. We may write أَلَّا، أَن لَّا، أَنْ لَا that not, and إِلَّا 
<lb/>for إِن لَّا it not; but عَمَّا from what is better so written for
<lb/>  عَنْ مَاas is إِمَّا  إِنْ مَاfor  if with نَا الزَّائِدَةُ redundant mâ
<lb/>(see § 353*).
<lb/>(c) With he letter ت after ظ ط ض ذ د ث in certain parts
<lb/>of the verb, as  أَرَدتُّI wished: this practice is, however, more
<lb/>than questionable.
<lb/>REM. b. If the verb ends in ت it naturally unites with a
<lb/>second  تas نَبَّتَّ nabbattu I sowed or planted for نَبَّتْتُ 
<lb/>15. hamzħ compression (of upper part of windpipe)  ءto
<lb/>which a 'alif most commonly serves as  عِمَادٌ'imâd support, may
<lb/>almost be reckoned by Europeans as the alphabet's initial consonant.
<lb/>It is equivalent to the French h aspirée (which to English
<lb/>sense is not, except in Normandy, sounded),and it may be
<lb/>heard between the two words le onze and between la onzième.
<lb/>If our own definite article be pronounced before a vowel as before
<lb/>a consonant, we can only prevent liaison by employing hamzah;
<lb/>thus thö 'orange (ö as E in the book). Arabs would transcribe
<lb/>a nice house anaishaus but an'aishaus for an ice house.
<lb/>REM. a. When a connective 'alif (see § 18) requires vowelling,
<lb/>the vowel mark is better written without hamazaħ, thus اَلْ the,
<lb/>  اِبْنٌson (see § 19 rem. d).
<lb/>REM. c. Hamzah is marked btween ا and sukûn or the
<lb/>following vowel; but we find  مَلَئِهِhis chiefs,  خَاشِئينَobject,
<lb/>and even  بَئشٌgriexous.
<pb n="12">
<lb/>REM. d. Hamzah is most perceptible in the middle of a
<lb/>word as  اَلْقُرْآنُfor (see § 23)  اَلْقُرْأَانُal qur'ânu (not qurânu)
<lb/>the Corân.
<lb/>REM. e. Hamzah and 'alif are called  أَلِفُ الْقَطْعِthe 'alif of severance.
<lb/>16. We have spoken in the preceding section of 'alif serving
<lb/>most commonly as 'imâd to hamzaħ; in certain circumstances this
<lb/>position may be taken by  وor ى the latter appearing without
<lb/>dots (see §§ 131 et seq., 238, 240, 316 d and 361 a rem.), thus
<lb/>  مُنْشِىءٌproducer.
<lb/>17. Hamzaħ alone, instead of ؤ إ أ or ىء is written,
<lb/>(a) always at a word's end, after sukûn or a letter of prolongation,
<lb/>as  جَاءَhe came,  سُوءٌevil,  مَجِيءٌa coming,  ظِمْءٌthirst;
<lb/>and in the middle of a word after 'alif of prolongation provided
<lb/>the hamzaħ bears fat&hdot;aħ as acc.  أَعْدَاءَكُمْyour enemies, but nom.
<lb/> أَعْدَآؤُكُمْ , dep. أَعْدآئِكُمْ 
<lb/>Note. For أَعْدَآءَكُمْ جَآءَ see § 22, and for  مَجِيءٌ سُوءٌsee
<lb/>§ 23 rem. c.
<lb/>(b) frequently in the middle of words after و or ي of prolongation
<lb/>and after sukûn, as  سُوءَىa mischief for مَشِيئَةٌ سُوؤَى 
<lb/>wish for  مَشِيئَةٌ يَسْئَلُ he asks for يَسْأَلُ ; also after kasraħ and
<lb/>&ddot;ammah before ي  or  وof prolongation;  خَاطِئينَkhâ&tdot;i'îna sinners
<lb/>for  رُءُوسٌ خَاطِئِينَru'ûsun heads for رُؤُوشٌ Sometimes it is
<lb/>improperly placed over the letter of prolongation, as خَطِيَةٌ for
<lb/>  خَطِيَةٌor خَطِيئَةٌ kha&tdot;î'aħun sin.
<lb/>REM. b. Hamzaħ may under certain circumstances be changed
<pb n="13">
<lb/>into a weak letter, as مِيةٌ for مِئَةٌ (see § 325 rem. a),  نَبِيُّfor
<lb/>  نَبِيءٌprophet, فَيٌّ for فَيْءٌ shade,  رَاسٌfor رَأْسٌ head بِيرٌ for بِئْرٌ a

<lb/>NOTE. For  آمَنَّا آلِهَةٌsee § 23, and for  مَشِيئَةٌ سُوءَىrem. c.
<lb/>REM. c. The name  دَآءُودُDavid is always pronounced dâ'ûd
<lb/>however it may be written.
<lb/>18. Some Arabic words begin with connective 'alif over
<lb/>which is marked waçlaħ sign of union ~ hereinafter transliterated
<lb/>by hyphen, because the word and its predecessor are spoken as
<lb/>one; thus  عَبْدُ اللهِ 'abdu -llâhi servant of God,  وَادْعُوهُwa -d'ûhu
<lb/>and call ye upon Him.
<lb/>19. Elision takes place to form the union
<lb/>(a) with the vowel of  اَلْthe, as  يَوْمُ الدِّينِthe day of the judgment.
<lb/>NOTE. As regards  اَلَّذِيsee § 347.
<lb/>(b) in regular Imperatives of the first form, as  قَالَ اصْبِرْhe
<lb/>said, Be patient; instead of اِصْبِرْ 
<lb/>(c) in certain derivatives belonging to the seventh and following
<lb/>forms of the verbs (see § 35), as وَانْقَلَبُوا and they were
<lb/>changed; instead of اِنْقَلَبُوا 
<lb/>(d) in  اِبْنٌson,  اِثْنَانِtwo,  اِمْرَأَةٌa woman,  اِسْمٌname, and a
<lb/>few other nouns.
<lb/>REM. c. In most of these words the 'alif and vowel are prosthetic,
<lb/>i. e. prefixed to a vowelless initial consonant' for the sake
<lb/>of euphony (see § 26).
<pb n="14">
<lb/>REM. d. It is obviously an error t begin a sentence with~آ 
<lb/>in such case the connective 'alif is written without hamzaħ but
<lb/>with a vowel, as  اَلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِPraise belongs to God.
<lb/>REM. f. Waçlaħ and 'alif are called  أَلِفُ الْوَصْلِthe 'alif of union.
<lb/>20. The connective 'alif may follow
<lb/>(a) a short vowel, which then absorbs it (see § 18).
<lb/>(b) a long vowel, which is then shortened in pronunciation
<lb/>to comply with § 25; as  فِى الْأَرْضِfî -l 'ar&ddot;i to be read fil'ar&ddot;i
<lb/>in the earth  اِهْدِنَا الصِّراَطَihdinâ -l çirâ&tdot;a to be read ihdinaççirâ&tdot;a
<lb/>guide us (on) the way: but the suffixes of the 1st pers. sing.

<lb/>  ( آيَاتِي الَّذِينَ ) سَأَصْرِقُ عَنْ آيَاتِىَ الَّذِينَI will divert from
<lb/>my signs those who.
<lb/>(c) a diphthong, which usually is resolved into two simple
<lb/>vowels; but  أَوْor and لَوْ if take kasra, thus ضَمِيرُ التَّوْكِيدِ أّوِ

<lb/>name of God, which by way of compensation is written بسم 
<lb/>(b) from  اِبْنٌin a genealogical series, with certain exceptions.
<lb/>(c) from  اَلْthe preceded by  لِto (see § 356 c) as لِلْبَيَانِ 
<lb/>certainly the man for لاِلرَّجُلُ . When three lâms occur one is
<lb/>omitted, thus  لِلَّهِto God for لِاللهِ 
<lb/>(d) from words preceded by the interrogative particle  (see
<lb/>§ 361 a).
<lb/>22 Maddaħ extension  ~does not admit of transliteration,
<lb/>being either superfluous or an abbreviation or marking an
<lb/>abbreviation. Thus it is customary to omit 'alif which, with
<lb/>hamzaħ and a vowel or tanwîn, follows a 'alif of prolongation;
<lb/>then by way of compensation maddaħ is written over the remaining
<lb/>'alif, as  سَآئِلٌone who asks for  جَآءَ شَاإِلٌhe came for جَاأض 
<lb/>  أَعْدَآءَكُمْyour enemies for أَعْدَاأّكُمْ 
<lb/>23. hamzaħ and 'alif آ also represent a 'alif with hamzah
<lb/>and fat&hdotah followed by 'alif of prolongation أَا or by 'alif with
<lb/>hamzah and sukûn  أَأْas  آلَhe returned for أَالَ ءَآلَ آيَةٌ،a sign,
<lb/>verse for  أَايَةٌfor  آلهِةٌ، أَوَيَةٌgods for آمَنَّا، أّأْلِهَةُ we believed for أّأْمّنَّا 
<lb/>  سَيِّآتٌfor  سَيِّئَاتٌplural of  سَيِّئَةٌan evil (see § 242 Note 2).
<pb n="16">
<lb/>REM. c. hamzaħ is sometimes placed over و and ي of prolongation
<lb/>when followed by hamzaħ, as سُوءَى، مَجِيءٌ، سُوءٌ 
<lb/>  مَشِيئَةٌit serves in manuscript to prevent hamzaħ appearing to
<lb/>be upon the letter of prolongation.
<lb/>REM. d. The same mark  ~ is written over abbreviations, as
<lb/>  الخto its end i.e. etcaetera (see § 451 c).
<lb/>24. An open syllable ends with a long or short vowel.
<lb/>25. A shut syllable ends with a consonant, and its vowel is
<lb/>most commonly short.
<lb/>26. A syllable cannot begin with two consonants: foreign
<lb/>words commencing so are transcribed by Arabian grammarians
<lb/>with an additional vowel, thus franks becomes إفْرِنْجُ Europeans
<lb/>pronounced colloquially faranj or farang.
<lb/>27. A syllable cannot end with two consonants, except
<lb/>  بِالْوَقْفِbi -l waqfi in pause, which ought to be made only when
<lb/>required by sense, but which is really more frequent; as لَهُ الَمُلْكْ 
<lb/>  وَلَهُ الْحَمْدْ(compare Elementary Arabic: First reading book,
<lb/>page 27 top line) to Him belong the dominion and the praise,
<lb/>witness alos the Moslem credo phonetically written as pronounced
<lb/>at Damascus  لَا إلهْ إلَّا اللهْ وَمُحَمَّدٌ لاَّسُولُ اللهْlâ'ilâh: 'illallâh:
<lb/>wamu&hdot;ammdurrasûlullâh There is no god but God and Mu&hdot;ammad
<lb/>is His apostle. In the Urdu translation of this book – will
<lb/>mark the shortest pause then, one of medium lenght and as in
<lb/>English the longest.
<lb/>NOTE. Professor de Goeje appends to vol ii § 95 f of Wright's
<lb/>Grammar an instructive footnote condemning pedantic speech,
<pb n="17">
<lb/>and he gives reference to a MS at Leyden. In fact case-endings
<lb/>are nearly always dropped in  اَلدَّارِجُal dârij current speech:
<lb/>throughout Arabia the proper name  اِبْنُ رَشِيدٍis pronounced
<lb/>ibrrashîd by Badawîn (Bedouins). The accusative is most often
<lb/>heard, as  مَرْحَبًاmar&hdot;abaû (see § 435 b) welcome pronounced in
<lb/>pause mar&hdot;abâ (see § 8 rem. a).
<lb/>28. The accent will not occasion difficulty to Englishmen
<lb/>who acquire pronunciation of Arabic consonants by reading the
<lb/>Corân aloud after a Moslem: it is designed to ensure grammatical
<lb/>accuracy; thus  يُسَبِّخُ(see Elementary Arabic: First
<lb/>reading book, page  26bottom line) is pronounced yusabbí&hdot;u for
<lb/>fear of saying yusábbi&hdot;û. Colloquial accentuation differs with
<lb/>the locality; thus  مُصْطَفَى اللهِmuç&tdot;afa -llâhi chosen of God is
<lb/>múç&tdot;afa in Syria, and in Egypt muç&tdot;áfa or even muç&tdot;âfa.
<lb/>32. Numbers were anciently expressed by letters whose
<lb/>numerical value may be learnt in the following order أَبْجَدْ هَوَّزْ 
<lb/>  حَطِّي كَلَمَنْ سَعْفَصْ قَرَشَتْ ثَخَذْ ضَظَغْsix consonants, forming
<lb/>the last two words, being supplementary to the Hebrew and
<lb/>Aramaic alphabets. Between the analysis and text of Elementary
<lb/>Arabic: First reading book will be found a Table, which gives
<lb/>the Phoenician, modern Hebrew, and other alphabets. The Arabic
<lb/>figures now employed are
<lb/> 0987654321 
<lb/>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
<lb/>and they are used in our order, thus 983605 506389.
<lb/>PART II.
<lb/>ETYMOLOGY OR THE PARTS OF SPEECH.
<lb/>33. Verbs are mostly triliteral (containing three radical
<lb/>letters) but some are quadriliteral.
<lb/>34. From the first or ground-form are derived other forms
<lb/>expressing modifications of the idea. conveyed by the first (see
<lb/>§ 369 Table 3 et seq.).
<lb/>35. The forms of the triliteral verb are fifteen, as follows:
<lb/> اِفْعَوَّلَ xiii اِسْتَفْعَلَ x اِنْفَعَلَ vii أَفْعَلَ iv فَعَلَ i
     اِفْعَنْلَلَ xiv اَفْعَالَّ xi اَفْتَعَلَ viii تَفَعَّلَ v فّعَّلَ ii
     اِفْعَنْلَى xv اِفْعَوْعَلَ xii اِفْعَلَّ ix تَفَاعَلَ vi فَاعَلَ iii
<lb/>REM. a. The 3rd pers. sing. mase. Perf. active, being the
<lb/>simplest form of the verb, is used as paradigm, but for shortness'
<lb/>sake we translate it by the English infinitive; thus  ; كَلَمَ to wound
<lb/>instead of he has wounded.
<lb/>REM. b. Arabian grammarians use the verb  فَعَلَas paradigm;
<lb/>hence the first radical of the triliteral verb is called اّلْفَآءُ al fâ',
<lb/>the second  اَلْعَيْنُal 'ain, and the third  اَللَّامُal lâm.
<lb/>36. The first form is generally transitive or intransitive in
<lb/>signification, according to the vowel which accompanies its second radical.
<pb n="19">
<lb/>37. The second radical's vowel is a in most transitive verbs, as
<lb/>  ضَرَبَto beat; and some intransitive, as  رَشَدَto go the right way.
<lb/>38. Vowel i in similar position usually shows an intransitive
<lb/>signification, u invariably: the i indicating what is temporary or
<lb/>accidental, as  سَلِمَto be safe; whilst u (meaning rarely to become
<lb/>what one was not before, as شَرُفَ to become noble) indicates a
<lb/>permanent state or inherent quality, as حَشُنَ to be beautiful.
<lb/>REM. a. Many verbs of the form  فَعِلَare transitive according to our ideas.
<lb/>NOTE. The following sections give a general view of some
<lb/>derived forms without taking into account whether the verbs
<lb/>govern an accusative, or by help of prepositions a dependent
<lb/>(see § 423).
<lb/>40. The second form  فَعَّلَis in meaning intensive or extensive.
<lb/>Originally it implies an act done with force, during long,
<lb/>by a number, or repeatedly; as  سَخِرَto mock  سَخَّرَto subject,
<lb/>treat as object,  صَرَفَto turn, shift  صَلَّبَthe same but of several
<lb/>objects,  صَلَبَto crucify  صَلَّبَthe same of may,  فَصَلَto separate
<lb/>  فَصَلَto divide ito several pieces,  قَتَلَto kill  قَتَّلَto massacre,
<lb/>  قَطَعَto cut قَطَّعَ to mangle,  كَفَرَto cover up, ignore  كَفَّرَto efface,
<lb/>  مَدَّto extend مَدَّدَ to stretch much or often,  مَسَكَto hold  مَسَّكَto
<lb/>hold tight.
<lb/>41. Not less usual is the secondary signification, (a) verbs
<lb/>intransitive in the first form becoming transitive in the second;
<lb/>as  أَدُبَto be well brought up  أَدَّبَto bestow a good education,
<lb/>punish,  تَبِرَto perish  تَبَّرَto destroy,  حَرُمَto be unlawful  حَرَّمَto
<pb n="20">
<lb/>forbid,  دَمَرَto perish utterly  دَمَّرَto destroy entirely,  سَارَto go
<lb/>  سَيَّرَto make go,  قَوِيَto be strong  قَوَّىto strengthen, encourage,
<lb/>  نَبَتَto spring forth  نَبَّتَto plant or sow, and
<lb/>(b) those transitive in the first, causative; as  بَلَغَto reach,
<lb/>attain  بَلَّغَto bring,  ذَكَرَto remember  ذَكّرَto remind,  عَدَاto pass
<lb/>  عَدَّىِto make pass and to give a verb a transitive signification,
<lb/>  عَذَبَto abstain,  عَذَّبَto restrain by punishment,  فَسَرَto discover
<lb/>  فَسَّرَto explain,  قَرُبَto be near  قَرَّبَto bring near.
<lb/>REM. b. This form is often declarative or estimative, as
<lb/>  صَدَقَto tell the truth  صَدَّقَto think that one tells the truth,
<lb/>believe one,  كَذَبَto lie  كَذَّبَto call one a liar,  فَضَلَto surpass
<lb/>  فَضَّلَto regard as superior, favour.
<lb/>REM. c. This form is very frequently denominative, i.e.
<lb/>derived from a noun; as  بَدَّلَto substitute from  بَدَلٌsomething
<lb/>given or received in exchange,  سَلَّمَ عَلَيْهِhe said to him سَلَامٌ 
<lb/>(peace be upon thee),  صّوَّرَto fashion from  صُورَةٌan image,  صَوَّرَto
<lb/>shade from  ظِلٌّshadow,  كَلَّمَto speak with from  كَلَامٌspeech,
<lb/>  نَبَّأَto inform from  نَبَأٌnews (perhaps originally something which
<lb/>has emerged or arisen),  نَوَّنَto write the letter nún from  نُونٌn.
<lb/>NOTE. It is difficult to connect  سَبَّحَto praise with  سَبَحَto
<lb/>swim: accordingly the native grammarians call  سَبَّحَ denominative
<lb/>of  سسُبْحانٌsee  435 a Note. The verb  عَزَّزَ(which
<lb/>generally means he disciplined, chastized, constrained by punishment)
<lb/>in the exceptional sense he helped may possible be a
<lb/>denominative from the Hebrew ' ezer help (see I Samuel vii. 12).
<lb/>The noun does not occur in Arabic with that signification.
<pb n="21">
<lb/>43. The third form   فَاعَلَimplies
<lb/>(a) the effort or attempt to perform an act which the first
<lb/>form denotes as immediately affecting an object, the idea of
<lb/>reciprocity being sometimes added; as  عَطَاto receive  عَاطَىto
<lb/>receive from each other, give mutually,  غَلَبَto overcome  غَالَبَto
<lb/>try to overcome,  قَرَأَto read  قَارَأَto read together, teach mutually,
<lb/>  لَأَمَto join together  لَآءَمَto reconcile,  مَدَّto extend  مَادَدَand مَادَّ to
<lb/>contend in pulling,  وَعَدَto promise  وَاعَدَto fix time and place for
<lb/>execution of a promise.
<lb/>(b) This form sometimes governs directly, not without the
<lb/>idea of reciprocity, when the first or fourth form governs its
<lb/>object by help of a preposition, as  أَرْسَلَ إِلَى السَّلْطَانَhe sent
<lb/>(a message) to the Sultan  رَاسَلَ السُّطَانَ he interchanged messages,
<lb/>corresponded, with the Sultan,  قَالَ لَهُhe said to him something
<lb/>  قَاوَلَهُhe conversed with him.
<lb/>(c) When the first form denotes a quality or state (see § 75)
<lb/>  فَاعَلَindicates affecting a person by the quality or bringing him
<lb/>into the state, as  حَسُنَto be good or kind  حَاسَنَهُhe treated him
<lb/>kindly,  طَاعَto be submissive  طَاوَعَto comply with  نَعَمَto lead
<lb/>a comfortable life  نَاعَمَهُhe found him means of doing so.
<lb/>REM. a. This form is sometimes denominative, as  ضَاعَفَto
<lb/>double, multiply from  ضِعْفٌthe like or equal.
<lb/>REM. c. In Elementary Arabic: First reading book page أا 
<lb/>bottom line  جَاوَزْنَا بِmay be rendered We caused to pass
<lb/>(see § 456 b).
<lb/>NOTE. The form of the verb  بَارَكَhe blessed may be due to
<lb/>Hebrew, from which it is most probably derived (see § 455 Note).
<pb n="22">
<lb/>45. The fourth form  أَفْعَلَis factitive or causative, (a) verbs
<lb/>intransitive in the first form becoming transitive; as  أَتْىto come
<lb/>  آتَىto bring,  أَذِيَto experience damage  آذَىto hurt,  أَسِفَto
<lb/>grieve  آسَفَto make grieve,  تَمَّto be finished  أَتَمَّto finish,  حَبَّfor
<lb/>  حَبُبَto be an object of love  أَحَبَّto love i.e. treat as an object of
<lb/>love,  حَلَّto be lawful  أَحَلَّto make lawful  حَيِيَto live  أَحْيَىto
<lb/>bring to life,  خَرَجَto come forth  أَخْرَجَto produce,  سَلِمَto be safe
<lb/>  أَسْلَمَto preserve  سَنَدَto lean  أَسْنَدَto cause to lean, support, شَمِتَ 
<lb/>to rejoice at another's trouble  أَشْمَتَto make so to rejoice,  صَلَحَto be
<lb/>good  أَصْلَحَto make good, do good, follow right action,  ضَلَّto err
<lb/>  أَضَلَّto lead into error,  ضَاعَto be lost  أَضَاعَto abandon,  طَاعَto be
<lb/>submissive  أَطَاعَto obey,  طَالَto be long  أَطَالَto prolong,  عَلَنَto
<lb/>be public  أَعْلَنَto publish,  غَرِقَto be drowned  أَغْرَقَto cause to
<lb/>drown,  فَرَغَto be empty  أَفْرَغَto empty by pouring out,  فَسَدَto be
<lb/>spoilt  أَفْسَدَto commit disorders,  مَاتَto die  أَمَاتَto cause to die,
<lb/>  نَذِرَto be on one's guard  أَنْذَرَto warn,  نَزَلَto descend  أَنْزَلَto
<lb/>send down,  نَعَمَto live agreeably  أَنْعَمَto bless,  نَفِقَto be expended
<lb/>  أَنْفَقَto expend,  نَكِرَto be strange  أَنْكَرَto regard as strage,
<lb/>disavow,  هَلَكَto perish  أَهْلَكَto destroy.
<lb/>(b) Verbs transitive in the first form become doubly transitive;
<lb/>as  حَاَطَto guard, observe  أَحَاطَto cause one's knowledge to
<lb/>encompass, comprehend,  دَخَلَto go into  أَدْخَلَto cause to enter,
<lb/>  رَأَى الشَّيْءَhe saw the thing  أَرَهُ الشَّيْءَhe showed him the thing,
<lb/>  رَجَاto hope for  أَرْجَاىto put off,  عَطَاto receive  أَعْطَىto give,
<pb n="23">
<lb/>  غَشِيَto cover, conceal  أَغْشَىto cause to cover,  قَرَأَto read  أَقْرَأَto
<lb/>teach reading or reciting,  لَقِيَto meet  أَلْقَىto throw,  مَدَّto extend
<lb/>  أّمَدَّto cause increase,  وَرِثَto inherit  أَوْرَثَto cause to inherit,
<lb/>  وَقَىto guard  أَوْقَىto make to guard.
<lb/>REM. a. When both the second and fourth forms of a verb
<lb/>are causative they have in some cases different signification, in
<lb/>others the same; as  أَذِنَto give ear to  أَذَّنَand  آذَنَto cause
<lb/>people to listen, announce, declare,  عَلِمَto know  عَلَّمَto teach
<lb/>  أَعْلَمَto inform,  نَجَاto escape  نَجَّىand  أَنْجَىto deliver.
<lb/>REM. b. The fourth form, like the second, is sometimes
<lb/>declarative or estimative; as  أَمُنَto be faithful  آمَنَto find
<lb/>trustworthy, believe,  حَمِدَto praise  أَحْمَدَto esteem praiseworthy.
<lb/>REM. c. This form is often denominative, as  أَبْلَغَto speak
<lb/>eloquently for  بَلَاغَةٌeloquence,  أَثْمَرَto bear fruit from  ثَمَرٌfruit,
<lb/>  أَجْرَمَto be guilty from  جُرْمٌa crime,  أَحْسَنَto act well from حَسَنٌ 
<lb/>good, beautiful,  أَخْطَأَto err from  خَطَأَa blunder, fault,  أَرْسَلَto
<lb/>send from  رَسُولٌa message, apostle,  أَسَرَّto conceal from  سِرَّa
<lb/>secret  أَسْرَعَto make haste from  سُرْعَةٌpromptitude,  أَسْلَمَto turn
<lb/>Moslem from  إِسْلَامٌIslâm *,  أَسَآءَto do ill from  سُوءٌevil,  أَقْرَضَto
<lb/>lend from  قَرْضٌa loan,  أَقَامَto remain in a place from  مَقَامٌa
<lb/>place,  أَمْهَلَto grant a respite or delay from  مَهْلٌgentleness,
<lb/>leisurely acting. There is another class of denominative, as
<lb/>  أَبَانَto become plain from  بَيِّنٌevident,  أَحْرَمَto enter the sacred
<lb/>* Islâm may mean in English the religion's geographical area, or the
<lb/>religion itself which is better called Islâmism as we say Judaism.
<pb n="24">
<lb/>territory from  حَرَمٌa holy place,  أَعْوَزَto become destitute from
<lb/>  عَوَزٌwant,  أَفْلَسَto become penniless from  فَلْسٌa copper coin,
<lb/>  أَمْكَنَto find a place, become possible from  مَكَانٌa place; and
<lb/>somewhat analogous is  أَيْسَرَto arrive at ease from  يَسَرَto be easy.
<lb/>NOTE. Beside the above must be mentioned  أَرَادَto wish
<lb/>which cannot be immediately derived from  رَادَto go to and fro;
<lb/>  أَشَارَto indicate, point out from  شَارَto exhibit;  أَصَابَto direct the
<lb/>course of something expressly at, hit the mark whence the
<lb/>commoner meaning to overtake, befall from  صَابَto rush down
<lb/>as water;  أَفْلَحَto be prosperous from  فَلَحَto be plough;  أَفَاقَto
<lb/>recover from illness or a swoon from  فَاقَto be above;  أَقَلَّto treat
<lb/>as light, carry easily from  قَلَّwhich means in Hebrew to be light
<lb/>in weight;  أَلْأَكَto send from the obsolete  أَوْحَى ، لَأَكَfrom وَحَى 
<lb/>both meaning to inspire, suggest; and  أَيْقَنَto make sure from
<lb/>  يَقِنَwhich means the same but is very unusual.
<lb/>47. The fifth form  تَفَعَّلَis reflexive of the second, being
<lb/>(as are the next following forms) called  مُطَاوِعٌa verb the
<lb/>grammatical agent of which complies with, i. e. receives the effect
<lb/>of, the action of the verb to which it is reflexive; as  أَذَّنَ to
<lb/>announce  تَأَذَّنَ to declare obligatory on oneself,  جَلَّىto make
<lb/>manifest, show  تَجَلَّى to make oneself manifest,  ذَكَّرَto remind
<lb/>  تَذَكَّرَto become reminded of,  رَأَّسَto appoint as chief  تَرَأَّسَto
<lb/>become chief,  طَيَّرَto make a bird fly  اِطَّيَّرَ(for  تَطَيَّرَ ) to draw an
<lb/>omen concerning oneself as from the flight of birds,  قَوَّلَto cause
<lb/>to say, to make out that a man said so and so  تَقَوَّلَto make out
<lb/>falsely that a man said so and so with a view to one's own
<pb n="25">
<lb/>advantage,  كَبَّرَto exalt  تَكَبَّرَto be proud,  كَلَّمَto address, accost
<lb/>  تَكَلَّمَto speak,  وَفَّىto pay in full  تَوَفَّىto receive payment in full,
<lb/>and of God to take to Himself,  وَكَّلَto make someone else to be
<lb/>one's wakil, i. e. a person left alone, an agent  تَوَكَّلَto trustworthy
<lb/>oneself to an agent who is fully empowered to act on one's behalf,
<lb/>  وَلّاهُ الْأَمْرَhe put him (another) in charge of the matter تَوَلَّى الْأَمْرَ 
<lb/>he took charge of the matter himself.
<lb/>REM. b. Some of Professor Wright's examples in § 47 are
<lb/>denominative, as  تَضَرَّعَto make humble supplication, earnestness is
<lb/>denoted by the doubled middle radical and self-advantage by
<lb/>the prefixed  تin comparison with  ضَرَعَto be humble. Further
<lb/>we observe  لَقِفَhe caught up, swallowed what was cast to him
<lb/>  لَقَّفَto cast a thing to another person to be seized and swallowed
<lb/>  تَلَقَّفَsimilar in sense to  لَقِفَbut with the idea added of taking
<lb/>for one's own advantage: while  تَمَدَّدَto stretch oneself is reflexive
<lb/>of the first form  مَدَّto extend. We find also  وَلِيَto be near or
<lb/>beside  وَلَّىto turn one's side or beck to another  تَوَلَّىto turn aside.
<lb/>48. By way of secondary meaning we have the effective, i.e.
<lb/>expressing effect, as  بَيَّنَto make distince  تَبَيَّنَto appear clear,
<lb/>  عَدَّىto give a verb a transitive signification  تَعَدَّىto be transitive.
<lb/>50. The sixth form  تَفَاعَلَis connected with the third: it is
<lb/>reflexive, and frequently simulative especially when the ground
<lb/>form is intransitive, thus  تَبَآءَسَto feign poverty from  بَئِسَto be
<lb/>poor. Also we find  تَخَاطَأَwrongly to attribute error to oneself
<pb n="26">
<lb/>which is reflexive and intensive of  تَخَطَّأَto impute error to another,
<lb/>from  خَطِىءَto do wrong. More often it is reciprocal,
<lb/>as  آمَرَto consult with  تَآمَرَand  تَوَامَرَto deliberate in common,
<lb/>  سَايَرَto accompany  تَسَايَرَto travel in company,  عَاوَنَto help
<lb/>  تَعَاوَنَto help one another,  قَاَتلَهُhe fought with him  تَقَاتَلَاthe two
<lb/>fought with one another; while  مَادَدَand  مَادَّto contend in pulling
<lb/>make  تَمَادَدَand  تَمَادَّof two person together to stretch a cloth.
<lb/>REM. a. When used of God  تَبَارَكَand  تَعَالَىillustrate the
<lb/>reflexive force of this form:  تَبَارَكَ اللهُGod has made Himself
<lb/>most blessed,  تَعَالَى اللهُGod has exalted Himself above all,
<lb/>see § 401 rem.
<lb/>REM. c. This form is appropriate to actions that take place
<lb/>bit by bit, as  سَقَطَto fall  تَسَاقَطَto fall one by one (as leaves).
<lb/>NOTE. From  غَبَنَto cheat غَابَنَ (should mean if it existed)
<lb/>of two persons that one cheated the other and  تَغَابَنَmeans of
<lb/>many that they cheated one another whence  تَغَابُنٌgeneral deception,
<lb/>see § 202.
<lb/>52. The seventh form  اِنْفَعَلَis originally in certain ways
<lb/>reflexive of the first, and approaches to a passive, being sometimes
<lb/>effective, as  بَجَسَto make flow  اِنْبَحَسَto gush  جَلَاto
<lb/>become clear, manifest  اِنْجَلَىof anxiety to be cleared away, سَبَأَ 
<lb/>to skin  اِنْسَبَأَof the skin to be stripped off,  سَاقَto drive  اِنْسَاقَto
<lb/>be driven,  قَطَعَto cut  اِنْقَطَعَto be cut off, to be ended, to end,
<lb/>  قَلَبَto change, invert  اِنْقَلَبَto be changed, translated as by death.
<pb n="27">
<lb/>53. This form may imply that a person allows of an act being
<lb/>done to himself, as  جَرَّto drag.  اِنْجَرَّto let oneself be dragged.
<lb/>NOTE. We employ  اِنْجَأَثَto split itself as paradigm, though
<lb/>the word is little known.
<lb/>55. The eighth form  اِفْتَعَلَis reflexive of the first; the reflex
<lb/>object being (a) the direct object, as  سَتَرَto conceal  اِسْتَتَرَto conceal
<lb/>oneself,  فَرَقَto divide  اِفْتَرَقَto go asunder,  مَدَّto stretch a thing
<lb/>  اِمْتَدَّof a thing to stretch itself,  وَقَىto guard  اِتَّقَىto guard
<lb/>oneself, fear, or
<lb/>(b) the indirect object, implying for one's own advantage, as
<lb/>  أَجَرَto reward  اِيتَجَرَto give alms seeking a reward,  خَارَto obtain
<lb/>good  اِخْتَارَto take to oneself that which seems good, choose  سَوِيَto
<lb/>be even with, equal to  اِسْتَوَىto settle oneself, become firm,  صَفَاto
<lb/>be pure and clear  اِصْطَفَىto take to oneself that which is pure and
<lb/>clear,  عَدَاto go beyond and leave behind  اِعْتَدَىto do so for one's
<lb/>own evil ends, transgress consciously,  فَرَىto cut out, manufacture
<lb/>  اِفْتَرَىto do so for one's own evil purpose, forge lies,  نَقَمَto punish
<lb/>  اِنْتَقَمَto avenge oneself,  يَسَرَto play at hazard  اِتَّسَرَto divide by lot a slain beast.
<lb/>56. Occasionally, like the sixth form, it is reciprocal, as
<lb/>  لَقِيَto meet  اِلْتَقَوْاand  تَلَاقَوْاthey met one another.
<lb/>57. Sometimes we find it passive, especially in verbs wanting
<lb/>the seventh form (see § 113), as  وَعَظَto admonish  اِتَّعَظَto be
<lb/>admonished; also  هَدَىto direct  اِهْتَدَىto be directed aright,
<lb/>which however may mean to find true direction.
<pb n="28">
<lb/>REM. a. In many verbs this form agrees nearly in meaning
<lb/>with the first, as  بَدَأَand  اِبْتَدَأَto begin,  تَبِعَand اِتَّبَع to follow,
<lb/>  هَنَأَand  اهْتَنَأَto put right.
<lb/>NOTE. We find also  بَئسَto be poor  اِبْتَأَسَto abase oneself.
<lb/>59. The ninth form  اِفْعَلَّand the eleventh  اِفْعَالَّchiefly
<lb/>express colours or defects, being indistinguishable in sense;
<lb/>thus  اِصْفَرَّand  اِصْفَارَّ to be yellow.
<lb/>61. The tenth form  اِسْتَفْعَلَis often reflexive of the fourth,
<lb/>as  أَحْيَاto bring to life, preserve alive  اِسْتَحْيَاto save alive for
<lb/>one's own advantage,  أَرْهَبَto cause fear  اِسْتَرْهَبَto call forth
<lb/>fear of oneself,  أَطَاعَto comply with a command  اِسْتَطَاعَto be able
<lb/>(i. e. to obey oneself),  أَغْنَىto make rich  اِسْتَغْنَىto make oneself
<lb/>independent,  أَقَرَّto cause to remain  اِسْتَقَرَّto stand firm,  أَقَامَto
<lb/>make stand upright  اِسْتَقَامَto hold oneself upright.
<lb/>62. This form may indicate a belief that some thing or
<lb/>person possesses the quality expressed by the first, as شُئِمَ 
<lb/>(passive) to be unlucky  اِسْتَشْأَمَto deem unlucky  ضَعُفَto be weak
<lb/>  اِسْتَضْعَفَto find weak, despise,  طَابَto be sweet and pleasant
<lb/>  اِسْتَطَابَto find sweet and pleasant,  كَبُرَto be great  اِسْتَكْبَرَto be
<lb/>puffed up with pride.
<lb/>63. This form very frequently means asking or seeking what
<lb/>is indicated by the first, as  أَذَنَto give permission  اِسْتَأْذَنَto ask
<lb/>permission,  سَقَىto give drink  اِسْتَسْقَىto ask for drink  غَفَرَto
<lb/>pardon  اِسْتَغْفَرَto ask pardon  فَهِمَto understand  اِسْتَفْهَمَto ask
<pb n="29">
<lb/>the meaning,  قَرَأَto read  اِسْتَقْرَأَto ask one to read,  وَقَعَto befall
<lb/>  اِسْتَوْقَعَto look for its coming to pass.
<lb/>65. This form is sometimes denominative, as  اِسْتَثْنَىto except
<lb/>from  ثُنْيَاa turning away from the course, an exception, اِسْتَخْلَفَ 
<lb/>to appoint as successor. deputy or caliph from  خَليِفَةٌsuccessor.
<lb/>NOTE. In meaning  اِسْتَيْسَرَto be easy is identical with تَيَسَّرَ 
<lb/>and nearly corresponds with  يَسَرَwhile  اِسْتَعَانَto ask help may
<lb/>be derived from  أَعَانَto help or, better still, called a denominative
<lb/>of  عَوْنٌhelp.
<lb/>66. The remaining forms of the triliteral verb need not be
<lb/>noticed here, as they do not occur in Elementary Arabic : First
<lb/>reading book;
<lb/>67 Quadriliteral verbs are formed (a) by repeating a biliteral
<lb/>root, as  غَرْغَرَto gargle; (b) adding a fourth letter, as جَلَطَ 
<lb/>and  جَلْمَطَto share the head; (c) as denominatives from nouns,
<lb/>often foreign, thus  جَوْرَبَto put on  جَوْرَبٌstockings; or (d) from
<lb/>certain common formulas, as  بَسْمَلَto say بِسْمِ اللهِ 
<lb/>68 There are three derived forms of the quadriliteral verb,
<lb/>which are conjugated in the paradigms (Table IV) of Wright's
<lb/>Grammar, viz.
<lb/>  اِفْعَلَلَّIV  اِفْعَنْلَلَIII  تَفَعْلَلَII  فَعْلَلَI
<lb/>73. Nearly all verbal forms, primitive or derivative, have
<lb/>two voices, the active and the passive; but we must often translate
<lb/>the latter impersonally, as  اُنْجُزَّa dragging took place
<pb n="30">
<lb/>  يُشَارُ إِلَيْهِمْone points to them  سُقِطَ فِي أَيْدِيهِمْa falling took
<lb/>place (or, an onslaught was made) upon their hands, i. e. they
<lb/>bit their fingers for disappointment (see  533).
<lb/>75. We speak of neuter verbs, meaning those which express
<lb/>a state or condition and therefore have no passive voice, as حَكُمَ 
<lb/>to be wise, but Arabian grammarians reckon them as active,
<lb/>distinguishing between  اَلْأَفْعَالُ الْتَعَدّيَةُtransitive verbs and
<lb/>  اَلْأَفْعَالُ غَيْرُ الْتَعَدِّيَةِintransitive verbs or  اَلْأَفْعَالُ اللَّازِمَة verbs
<lb/>that are confined to the subject.
<lb/>77. An Arabic verb has two States, the Perfect indicating
<lb/>a finished act, and the Imperfect an act that is just commencing
<lb/>or in progress.
<lb/>REM. a. Acquaintance with grammar will teach how to
<lb/>employ these States in explaining the temporal relations (past,
<lb/>present, and future) which non-semitic languages express by tenses.
<lb/>79. There are five moods: the Indicative which is common
<lb/>to the perfect and imperfect states; the Subjunctive, and Jussive
<lb/>(or Conditional) which are restricted to the imperfect; the
<lb/>Imperative which is expressed by a special form; and the
<lb/>Energetic which can be derived from the imperfect and from the imperative.
<lb/>80. By way Infinitives we have nomina actionis nouns
<lb/>expressing the action or quality (see § 195) In place of participles
<lb/>two verbal adjectives are used; nomen agentis denoting
<lb/>the agent, and nomen patientis the patient (see § 229).
<pb n="31">
<lb/>81. There are three numbers, Singular, Dual, and Plural;
<lb/>likewise three persons. the genders are two, Masculine and
<lb/>Feminine; but distinction cannot in all cases be made, as  أَقُولُ 
<lb/>I say, where the speaker's sex is not disclosed.
<lb/>83. Verbs are called strong when the three radical letters
<lb/>are retained throughout and undergo no change.
<lb/>REM. To contain  و، أor  يcauses a verb to be called weak
<lb/>(see § 126); but verbs in which the second and third radicals
<lb/>are identical (see § 120) we shall call strong.
<lb/>NOTE. Students must spare no pains to learn the conjugations
<lb/>in § 369 Tables 1,2 and 3; otherwise they will find the
<lb/>weak verbs difficult to impossibility.
<lb/>84. The numbers, persons, and genders of the verbs are
<lb/>expressed by means of personal pronouns, annexed to the various
<lb/>mood and states. These may be connected, i. e. prefixed or
<lb/>suffixed, in which case they are to be learned from the conjugations;
<lb/>thus  نَاwe wounded,  تُمْye in  كَلَمْتُمْye
<lb/>wounded,  يhe in  يَكْلِمُhe wounds (see § 369 Table 1)*:or they
<lb/>may be separate.
<lb/>89. The following table gives such separate personal pronouns
<lb/>as express the nominative: —
<lb/>SINGULAR.
<lb/>Feminine Common Masculine
<lb/>  هِىَshe  هُوَhe 3rd person
<lb/>  أَنْتِhou  أَنْتَthou 2nd ,,
<lb/>  أَنَاI  1st ,,
<lb/>* These pronouns are called  مُسْتَتِرٌconcealed see § 513.
<pb n="32">
<lb/>DUAL
<lb/>Feminine Common Masculine
<lb/>  هُمَاthey two 3rd person
<lb/>  أَنْتُمَاyet two 2nd ,,
<lb/>PLURAL
<lb/>  هُنَّthey  هُمْthey 3rd ,,
<lb/>  أَنْتُنَّye  أَنْتُمْye 2nd ,,
<lb/>  نَحْنَwe 1st ,,
<lb/>REM. c. For the older forms  هُمُand  أَنْتُمُsee § 20 d.
<lb/>NOTE. In § 185 are given pronominal suffixes expressing the
<lb/>accusative, and those expressing the dependent in § 317.
<lb/>90. Regarding first the active voice we observe that the 3rd
<lb/>pers. sing. masc. perfect of the ground form bears fat&hdot;aħ always
<lb/>on the first and third radicals.
<lb/>91. When the middle radical of the perfect has fat&hdot;ħ a
<lb/>verb must take either &ddot;ammaħ or kasraħ in the imperfect; as
<lb/>  بَطَلَto be worthless  ضَرَبَ، يَبْطُلُto strike  يَضْرِبُwhich we write
<lb/>  بَطَلَand  ضَرَبَAlso  أَثَرَto relate,  خَلَقَto create,
<lb/>  رَزَقَto provide,  سَكَنَto dwell,  شَكَرَto be thankful,
<lb/>  ظَلَمَto do wrong, injure,  عَرَشَto construct,  عَقَلَto
<lb/>understand,  فَسَقَto be impious,  نَتَقَto shake, wave, نَزَعَto pull out, .نَصَرَ
<lb/>to assist,  نَكَثَ ._ to break a promise.
<lb/>Many verbs admit of both forms; as  دَرَسَto study,  يَدْرُسُand
<lb/>  يَدْرِسُwhich we shorten into  دَرَسَalso  سَبَتَto keep Sabbath,
<lb/>  عَكَفَto cling.
<pb n="33">
<lb/>REM a. Verbs of which the second or third radical is a
<lb/>guttural (either  ه، غ، ع، خ، ح، أ ) may be exceptional; as
<lb/>  بَعَثَto send,  جَعَلَto make, place,  جَمَعَto collect,
<lb/>  خَسَأَto be driven away  رَأَسَto be the head of سَبَحَ 
<lb/>to swim,  سَحَرَto fascinate, enchant,  شَفَعَto intercede,
<lb/>  صَعَقَto strike with lightning,  صَفَحَto pardon,  صَنَعَto
<lb/>make,  فَتَحَto open  فَعَلَto do  قَطَعَto cut  قَهَرَto overcome
<lb/>  نَسَخَto supersede, transcribe,  نَصَحَto counsel  نَهَرَof
<lb/>water to flow,  نَهَىto forbid. Many however conform to the
<lb/>rule; as  أَخَذَto take, seize  بَلَغَto reach,  دَخَلَto enter,
<lb/>  رَجَعَto return,  زَعَمَto assert. Some verbs have more than
<lb/>one form; as  رَبَعَto take a fourth part,  صَلَحَto be good,
<lb/>  فَرَِغَto be vacant.
<lb/>NOTE. As paradigm we use فَعَُِلَ 
<lb/>92. When the second radical of the perfect has kasraħ,
<lb/>the imperfect bears fat&hdot;ħ; as  أَثِمَto sin,  حَبِطَto be vain,
<lb/>  خَطِىَto do wrong, sin,  رَهِبَto fear,  سَفِهَto be light-witted
<lb/>  شَهِدَto testify,  صَحِبَto consort with  صَعِقَto
<lb/>swoon,  صَغِرَto be small,  طَمِعَto desire,  عَجِبَto wonder,
<lb/>  عَجِلَto hasten,  عَمِلَto work, do,  عَهِدَto enjoin, covenant.
<lb/>REM. Exceptions are rare, as  بَئِسَto be in distress or
<lb/>poverty,  حَضَرَto be present, and  مَاتَto die for مَوِتَ (see § 157)
<lb/>which usually makes  يَمُوتُbut sometimes يَمِيتُ ، يَمَاتُ 
<lb/>93. When the middle radical of the perfect has &ddot;ammaħ the]
<lb/>imperfect bears the same, as  بَصُرَto see,  خَبُثَto be bad,
<pb n="34">
<lb/>  رَحُبَto be spacious,  سَفُهَto be light-witted,  شَهُدَto testify,
<lb/>  صَغُرَto be small,  كَبُرَto be great,  كَثُرَto be numerous,
<lb/>  نَهُوَto be intelligent.
<lb/>95. The indicative of the imperfect is distinguished by
<lb/>&ddot;ammaħ on the third radical, as  يَجْهَلُhe is ignorant; the subjunctive
<lb/>by fat&hdot;aħ, as  يَجْهَلَand the jussive by sukûn, as يَجْهَلْ 
<lb/>96. A termination  نَof the indicative is only retained in
<lb/>the subjunctive and jussive when required as mark of gender;
<lb/>otherwise it and  نِare rejected.
<lb/>97. The energetics are formed from the jussive by adding
<lb/>  نْ ، نَّ(subject to certain variations, which in case of
<lb/>Energetic I of the imperfect may be learnt from the paradigms in
<lb/>§369) thus,  يَبْعَثَنَّhe will certainly send from  يَبْعَثْjussive of
<lb/>  بَعَثَEnergetic II of the imperfect and the two energetics of
<lb/>the imperative are omitted from §369 as they do not occur in
<lb/>Elementary Arabic: First reading book.
<lb/>98. The imperative is formed by substituting a prosthetic
<lb/>vowel for the prefix of the jussive's 2nd sing.: when the second
<lb/>radical bears fat&hdot;ħ or kasraħ this vowel is kasraħ, and when
<lb/>&ddot;ammaħ it is &ddot;ammaħ; thus,  اِجْعَلْmake,  اِرْحَمْhave mercy upon,
<lb/>  اِكْشِفْremove,  اِعْدِلْbe just,  اُسْكُنْcalm thyself,  اُطْلُبْseek;
<lb/>and similarly with the feminine etc.
<lb/>REM. a. Concerning prosthetic vowels see § 19, rem. c.
<lb/>REM. b. Fat&hdot;aħ is never so employed.
<lb/>100. From the active voice the passive is distinguished by
<lb/>altered vowels (see § 369, Table 2) on th and second. radicals.
<pb n="35">
<lb/>REM. It makes no difference what characteristic vowels are
<lb/>employed in the active voice
<lb/>101. Instead of a passive imperative the jussive is used.
<lb/>102. The derived forms of strong verbs must be learned from
<lb/>§ 369, Table 3; attention being at an early stage confined to the
<lb/>first seven and the tenth form, i. e. neglecting the ninth, eleventh
<lb/>and following.
<lb/>107. The relation of passive to active will be found analogous
<lb/>to that in the ground form.
<lb/>REM. a. The imperfect passive of the first and fourth forms
<lb/>are identical in appearance.
<lb/>111. When the verbal root begins with ز، ذ، د، ج، ث، ت 
<lb/>  ظ، ط، ض، ص، ش، سthe characteristic  تof the fifth and
<lb/>sixth forms may lose its vowel and form a double letter with the
<lb/>first radical, to which when necessary a prosthetic 'alif and
<lb/>kasraħ must be added; as  اِطَّيَّرَ يَطَّيَّرُto draw an omen concerning
<lb/>onself for  اِسَّاقَطَ يَسَّاقَطُ ، تَطَيَّرَ يَتَطَبَّرُto fall one by one for
<lb/>  تَسَاقَطَ يَتَسَاقَطُ 
<lb/>112. The  تَof the fifth and sixth forms is sometimes
<lb/>omitted from those persons of the imperfect active to which
<lb/>  تَis prefixed; as  تَلَقَّفَshe swallows for  تَذَكَّرُ، تَتَلَقَّفَshe
<lb/>becomes reminded of for تَذَّكَّرُ، تَتَذَكَّرُ (see §111)
<lb/>115. If the first radical be  ث، تcharacteristic  تof the
<lb/>eighth form unites with the initial  تinto  تّand with initial ث 
<lb/>into  ث، تّas اِتَّبَعَ he followed for اِتْتَبَعَ .
<pb n="36">
<lb/>117. If the first radical be  ظ، ط، ض، صcharacteristic ت 
<lb/>is changed into  ،ط as اِصْطَفَيْتُI chose from  صَفَا(see § 55)
<lb/>and not اِصْتَفَيْتُ 
<lb/>120. Verbs with the middle radical doubled are conjugated
<lb/>in § 369, Tables 5 a, b and c : they differ from other strong verbs
<lb/>in two ways.
<lb/>(a) When both the initial and final radicals have vowels
<lb/>the middle rejects its vowel and becomes with the final a double
<lb/>to put down,  حَقَّto be fitting,  خَرَّto fall down,  دّكَّto
<lb/>pound,  ذَلَّto be abased,  شَحَّto be avaricious,  شَدَّto be
<lb/>severe,  ظَنَّto think,  عَزَّto be potent,  غَلَّto insert.
<lb/>(b) If the initial radical is without a vowel and final has
<lb/>one, then the middle radical throws its vowel to the initial and
<lb/>becomes with the final a double letter; as يَخِرُّ 
<lb/>for  يَغْلُلُ يَغًلُّ، يَدْكُكُ، يَدُكُّ، يَخْرِرُbut if the final radical be vowelless,
<lb/>no contraction is possible; as  ظَنَنْتُ، يَذْلِلْ، يَحْطُطْand this
<lb/>must be specially noted in the perfect of verbs like  حَبَّfor
<lb/>  حَبُبَto become loxed which makes  حَبُبْتَُِand like  مَسَّfor
<lb/>  مَسِسَto touch which makes مَسِسْتٌَِ 
<lb/>121. The jussive is sometimes identical with the subjunctive
<lb/>as  يَمُدَّfor يَمْدُدْ 
<lb/>124. In some derived forms will be found alternative
<lb/>vocalization : this is common when the doubled radical follows
<lb/> as مَادَدَ for  مَادَّsee § 25, rem.
<pb n="37">
<lb/>126. Verbs are called weak when one of the three radical
<lb/>letters is subject to transformation or rejection.
<lb/>128. Verbs with  ي، وfor a radical are unmistakeably
<lb/>weak, more so than those called hamzated.
<lb/>129. Verbs may be doubly weak (§ 171): and even trebly, as
<lb/>  أَوَىto resort to imperf.  يَأْوِيimpera. اِيوِ 
<lb/>130. Hamzated verbs fall into three classes according as
<lb/>hamzaħ serves for first, second or third radical : they are conjugated
<lb/>in § 369, Tables 6 to 8, differing from strong verbs
<lb/>especially as regards the 'imâd (see § 15) in the following ways.
<lb/>131. The 'alif with hamzaħ and sukûn  أْpreceded by &ddot;ammaħ
<lb/>becomes  دَنُؤْتَِ ؤْthou art mean not  دَنُأْتَِpreceded by kasraħ
<lb/>  خَطِئْتُ ءْI have done wrong not خَطِأْتُ 
<lb/>132. It is said by some that  ي وrepresent sounds
<lb/>toward which hamzaħ is inclined by the preceding vowel.
<lb/>REM. b. Instances occur like  أُوذِينَاwe were hurt for أُؤْذِينَا 
<lb/>  اِيذَنْgive ear for  اِيتِ ، اِئْذَنْcome for  اِئْتِ(see § 175) but
<lb/>in imperatives following  فَ، وَthe connective 'alif is rejected
<lb/>while hamzaħ with sukûn remains; thus  فَأْتِso then come.
<lb/>133. Similarly  أُbecomes  ؤُif preceded by fat&hdot;ħ, as  بَؤُسَto
<lb/>be brave not  إِ، بَأُسَ become ءِif preceded by fat&hdot;ħ, as fat&hdot;ħ
<lb/>to be in distress not  أَ، بَإِسَ become ؤَif preceded by &ddot;ammaħ, as
<lb/>  دَنُؤَto be ignoble not  أَ ، دَنُأَ become ءَif preceded by kasraħ, as
<pb n="38">
<lb/>  خَطِئَto do wrong not   إِ ، خَطِأَ becomes  ءِif preceded by &ddot;ammaħ,
<lb/>as  سُئِلَ(passive) he was asked not سُإِلَ 
<lb/>REM. At the end of a word  أُstands after fat&hdot;aħ, thus يَقْرَأُ 
<lb/>he reads but  يَقْرَؤُهُhe reads it.
<lb/>134. When preceded by a consonant with sukûn  أُbecomes ؤُ 
<lb/>as  يَبْؤُسُimperfect of  بَؤُسَnot  يَبْأُسُand  إِbecomes  ءِas, not
<lb/>  يَبْإِسَbut  يَبْئِسُwhich and  يَبْأَسُare imperfects of بَئِسَ 
<lb/>135. If alif of prolongation follows radical  أَat a word's
<lb/>beginning we write  آor  ءآor even  أ(see § 23) as  آمَرَto consult
<lb/>with for أَامَرَ ; and so when radical  أْfollows أَ as  آسَفَto make
<lb/>grieve for أَأْسَفَ 
<lb/>137. The verbs  أَخَذَto take  أَمَرَto command and
<lb/>  أَكَلَto eat make in the imperative  مُرْ، خُذْand كُلْ 
<lb/>138. The imperative  مُرْmay when following  وَor  فَrecover
<lb/>its first radical, but not so  خُذْor كُلْ thus وَأْمُرْ or وَمُرْbut وَمُرْ، وَأْمُرْ 
<lb/>139. In the eigth form of  أَخَذَthe first radical becomes
<lb/>assimilated to  تthus  اِتَّخَذَto take for oneself: this occurs with
<lb/>a few other verbs, but  اِتَّجَرَfrom  أَجَرَto reward is less common
<lb/>than  اِيتَجَرَwhich follows § 132, rem. b.
<lb/>140. Loss of hamzaħ occasionally takes place and we have
<lb/>  سَالَ يَسَالُ for سَأَلَto ask. The vowel may even be transferred,
<lb/>as  أَلَكَto send for أَلْأَكَ whence  مَلَكٌ for مَلْأَكٌan angel.
<pb n="39">
<lb/>A GRAMMAR.
<lb/>141. Weak verbs specially so called likewise fall into three
<lb/>classes according as  وor  ىis the first, the second, or the third radical.
<lb/>142. Verbs with  وas initial radical (see § 369, Table 9)
<lb/>which have kasraħ for characteristic vowel of the imperfect and
<lb/>imperative, reject  وin those forms. Thus  وَلَدَto bear children
<lb/>imperf  يَلِدُimpera. لِدْ  وَعَدَto promise imperf.  يَعِدُimpera.
<lb/>  وَجَدَ، عِدْto find inperf  يَجِدُimpera.  وَكَلَ ، قِتْto leave alone imperf.
<lb/>  يَكِلُimpera.  وَعَظَ، كِلْto warn imperf.  يَعِظُimpera. عِظْ 
<lb/>REM. a. A few verbs, having (contrary to § 92) kasraħ in
<lb/>both perfect and imperfect, lose their initial radical, as  وَثِقَto
<lb/>trust  وَرِثَ ، يَثِقُto inherit  وَلِىَ ، يَرِثُto be near يَلِي 
<lb/>143. But verbs with  وas initial radical, which have fat&hdot;aħ
<lb/>or &ddot;ammaħ for characteristic vowel of the imperfect and imperative,
<lb/>retain  وin those forms; as  وَسِنَto doze imperf. يَوْسَنُ 
<lb/>impera.  اِيسَنْ for وَبُلُ ، اِوْسَنْto be unwholesome imperf. يَوْبُلُ 
<lb/>impera.  وَجِلَ، اُوبُلْto fear imperf.  يَوْجَلُimpera.  اِيجَلْfor اِوْجَلْ 
<lb/>144. In certain verbs initial  وdrops from the imperfect and
<lb/>imperative notwithstanding that fat&hdotaħ is the characteristic
<lb/>vowel of these forms; as  وذرto leave  يَذَرُand  وَسِعَ ، ذَرْto be
<lb/>spacious يَسَعُand وَضَعَ ، سَعْto put down يَضَعُand وَقَعَ، ضَعْto fall يَقَعُ and قَعْ 
<lb/>REM. b.  وذرis not used in the perfect.
<pb n="40">
<lb/>145. If initial  وbe vowelless, a preceding kasraħ or &ddot;ammaħ
<lb/>changes it into  و، يof prolongation as may be seen in § 143
<lb/>with the imperatives of  وَبُلَ وَسِنَand وَجِلَ 
<lb/>146. Verbs with  يas initial radical are inflected almost
<lb/>like strong verbs, thus  يَسَرَ يَيْسِرُ(see § 369, Table 9).
<lb/>147. But if initial  يbe vowelless, a preceding kasraħ or
<lb/>&ddot;ammaħ changes it into  يor و of prolongation; thus the
<lb/>imperative of  يَسَرَto be easy is اِيسِرْ for اِيْسِرْ and the fourth
<lb/>form is  أَيْسَرَ يُوسِرُto arrive at ease.
<lb/>148. In the eight form  وand  يare assimilated to the
<lb/>characteristic  تthus producing  تّ as اِتَّقَىto fear for اِوْتَقَى 
<lb/>of which the nomen agentis is  مُتَّقٍdevout.
<lb/>149. Verbs with  ي ، وas middle radical are conjugated in
<lb/>§ 369, Tables 10 to 13: they differ from strong verbs only in the
<lb/>first, fourth, seventh, eight and tenth forms.
<lb/>150. In case the initial radical is without a vowel and the
<lb/>final has one, the vowel of the middle radical passes to the first
<lb/>and we employ a letter of prolongation homogeneous with the
<lb/>vowel which the first radical has now assumed; thus
<lb/>with form  يَطْوُفُ يَفْعُلُbecomes  يَطُوفُI of  طَافَto circle
<lb/>with form  يَدْيِنُ يَفْعِلُbecomes  يَدِينُI of  دَانَto obey
<lb/>with form  يَخْوَفُ يَفْعَلُbecomes  يَخَافُI of  خَافَto fear
<lb/>with form  do يَنْيَلُ becomes  يَنَالُI of  نَالَto reach
<lb/>with form  يُسْوَمُ يُفْعَلُbecomes  يُسَامُI of  سَامَto inflict
<pb n="41">
<lb/>with form  أَفْوَزَ أَفْعَلَbecomes  أَفَازَIV of  فَازَto obtain
<lb/>with form do.  أَضْيَعَ becomes  أَضَاعَIV of  ضَاعَto be lost
<lb/>with form  يُذْوِقُ يُفْعِلُbecomes  يُذِيقُIV  ذَاقَto taste
<lb/>with form  اِسْتَقْوَمَ اِسْتَفْعَلَbecomes  اِسْتَقَامَX  قَامَto stand
<lb/>with form  يَسْتَطْيِبُ يَسْتَفْعِلُbecomes  يَسْتَطِيبُX  طَابَto be good
<lb/>151. But if the final radical has sukûn, the long vowels
<lb/>  و ، يû become short, according ot § 25; thus
<lb/>with form  يَدُورْ يَفْعُلْbecomes  يَدُرْI of  دَارَto go round
<lb/>with form  يَعِينْ يَفْعِلْbecomes  يَعِنْI of  عَانَto flow
<lb/>with form  يَخَافْ يَفْعَلْbecomes  يَخَفْI of  خَافَto fear

<lb/>with form  أَحَاطْتَ أَفْعَلْتَbecomes  أَحَطْتَIV of  حَاطَto guard
<lb/>with form  يُقِيمْ يُفْعِلْbecomes  يُقِمْIV of  قَامَto stand
<lb/>with form  أَضِيعْ أَفْعِلْbecomes  أَضِعْIV of  ضَاعَto be lost
<lb/>REM.  يَكُنْfor  يَكُونْjussive of  كَانَto be is sometimes
<lb/>further abbreviated into  يَكُsee § 583 c.
<lb/>NOTE. We have  يَكُونَنَّhe will certainly be from  يَكُنْ(see
<lb/>§ 97) jussive of  كَانَto be : the letter of prolongation must
<lb/>reappear in obedience to § 150. So in the plural, thus  لَا تَخَافُواfear ye not.
<pb n="42">
<lb/>152. If follows that the first form's imperative needs no prosthetic alif; thus
<lb/>with form  اُكُونْ اُفْعُلْbecomes  كُنْfrom  كَانَto be
<lb/>with form  اِصِيرْ اِفْعِلْbecomes  صِرْfrom  صَارَto become
<lb/>with form  اِخَافْ اِفْعَلْbecomes  خَفْfrom  خَافَto fear
<lb/>with form  اُتُوبُوا اُفْعُلُواbecomes  تُوبُواfrom  تَابَto repent
<lb/>153. If three open syllables follow in immediate succession,
<lb/>the first of which has fat&hdot;aħ then 'alif of prolongation takes the
<lb/>middle radical's place; thus
<lb/>with form  نَوَرَ فَعَلَbecomes  نَارَI of  نَارَto shine
<lb/>with form do.  غَيَبَbecomes  غَابَI of  غَابَto be absent
<lb/>with form  كَوِدَ فَعِلَbecomes  كَادَI of  كَادَto be on the point of
<lb/>with form  طَوُلَ فَعُلَbecomes  طَالَI of  طَالَto be long
<lb/>with form  اِنْسَوَقَ اِنْفَعَلَbecomes  اِنْسَاقَVII of  سَاقَto drive
<lb/>with form  يَخْتَيِرُ يَفْتَعِلُbecomes  يَخْتَارُVIII of  خَارَto be good
<lb/>154. But if the first syllable's vowel be &ddot;mmaħ, and  وor
<lb/>  يbear kasraħ, we discard &ddot;ammaħ, taking kasraħ into its place,
<lb/>and adopt  يof prolongation instead of the middle radical; as
<lb/>with form  قُوِلَ فُعِلَbecomes  قِيلَpassive of  قَالَto say.
<lb/>155. If the first radical has fat&hdotaħ and the third sukûn, three cases arise.
<pb n="43">
<lb/>(a) The middle radical is  وor  يwith fat&hdot;aħ; when we
<lb/>discard it and its vowel, placing, if it was  و&ddot;ammaħ on the first
<lb/>radical, and kasraħ if it was  ي: thus
<lb/>with form  قَوَمْتَ فَعَلْتَbecomes  قُمْتَfrom  قَامَto stand
<lb/>with form do  سَيَرْتَbecomes  سِرْتَfrom  سَارَto go
<lb/>(b) The middle radical is  وwith &ddot;ammaħ or  يwith kasraħ;
<lb/>when we discard it and its vowel, but we place a vowel homogeneous
<lb/>with it upon the first radical: as
<lb/>with form  طَوُلْتَ فَعُلْتَbecomes  طُلْتَfrom  طَالَto be long
<lb/>with form  نَيِلْتَ فَعِلْتَbecomes  نِلْتَfrom  نَالَto reach
<lb/>(c) The middle radical is  وwith kasraħ; when we discard
<lb/>it and its vowel, placing kasraħ on the first radical : as
<lb/>with form  خَوِفْتَ فَعِلْتَbecomes  خِفْتَfrom  خَافَto fear
<lb/>with form do.  مَوِتْتَbecomes  مِتَّfrom  مَاتَto die
<lb/>156. In certain passive forms the  يof prolongation is
<lb/>shortened into kasraħ, when the third radical bears sukûn; thus
<lb/>  دِينْتَِ(for  دُيِنْتَِ ) becomes  دِنْتَِthou wast obeyed, which is identical
<lb/>in form with  دِنْتَِthou hast obeyed.
<lb/>157. Most verbs with  وas middle radical take &ddot;ammaħ in
<lb/>the imperfect, and most with  يtake kasraħ; but some of the
<lb/>form  فَعِلَtake fathdot;aħ. Thus
<lb/>  كَادَfor  كَوِدَto be on the point of makes  يَكَادُfor يَكْوَدُ 
<lb/>  خَافَfor  خَوِفَto fear on the point of makes  يَخَافُfor يَخْوَفُ 
<lb/>  شَآءَfor  شَيِئَto wish on the point of makes  يَشَآءَfor يَشْيَأُ 
<pb n="44">
<lb/>  نَامَfor  نَوِمَto sleep makes  يَنَامُfor يَنْوَمُ 
<lb/>  نَالَfor  نَيِلَto reach makes  يَنَالُfor يَنْيَلُ 
<lb/>We have mentioned (§ 92, rem.)  مَاتَfor  مَوِتَto die.
<lb/>164. Verbs with  وor  يas final radical are conjugated in
<lb/>§ 369, Tables 14 to 18: they are of five kinds:—
<lb/>(i) Final  وof form  فَعَلَas  دَنَاto be near for دَنَوَ 
<lb/>(ii) Final  يof form  فَعَلَas  بَغَىِto seek for بَغَيَ 
<lb/>(iii) Final  وof form فَعِلَ  رَضِيَas  to be pleased for رَضِوَ 
<lb/>(iv) Final  يof form  فَعِلَas  فَنِيَto perish for فَنِوَ 
<lb/>(v) Final  وof form  فَعُلَas  نَهُوَto be intelligent, prudent
<lb/>165. One of three things must happen: the final radical
<lb/>retains its consonantal power, or resolves itself into a vowel, or is elided.
<lb/>168. At the beginning of a syllable two things are possible.
<lb/>(a) The third radical maintains its power as a consonant,
<lb/>in  وَاawâ as  عَتَوَاthey two (masc.) were disobedient
<lb/>in  يَاayâ as  جَزَيَاthey two (masc.) rewarded
<lb/>in  وَuwa as  يَبْلُوَhe may try
<lb/>in  وَاuwâ as  يَعْفُوَانِthey two (masc.) condone
<lb/>in  يَiya as  عَمِيَhe was blind
<lb/>in  يَاiyâ as  غَنِيَا they two (masc.) were rich;
<lb/>also when following sukûn, as  عَدْوٌa transgressing,  رِضْوَانٌgrace,
<pb n="45">
<lb/>favour (see § 212 a). The letter  وin  وَiwa and in  وَاiwâ
<lb/>always becomes  يas  بُلِيَhe was tried for  بُلِوَThe letter  يis
<lb/>never found in  يَuya or in  يَاuyâ, though we have تُبُيِّنَ 
<lb/>and the like in verbs with  وor  يas middle radical.
<lb/>(b) The third radical is elided between a short vowel and 1
<lb/>or û: this involves contraction
<lb/>(i) either into a long vowel; namely
<lb/>  وُوuwû into  وû as  يَدْعُونَthey (masc.) call for يَدْعُوُونَ 
<lb/>  يُوiyû into  وû as  يَجْرُونَthey (masc.) flow for يَجْرِيُونَ 
<lb/>  وِيuwî into  يî as  تَرْجِينَthou (fem.) hopest for تَرْجُوِينَ 
<lb/>  يِيiyî into  يî as  تَسْقِينَthou (fem.) givest drink for تَسْقِيِنَ 
<lb/>(ii) or into a diphthong; namely
<lb/>  وُوawû into  وْa u as  صَفَوْاthey (masc.) were clear for صَفَوُوا 
<lb/>  يثوayû into  وْa u as  نَهَوْاthey (masc.) forbade for نَهَيُوا 
<lb/>  يِيayî into  يْai as  تَنْسَيْنَthou (fem.) forgettest for تَنْسَيِينَ 
<lb/>167. At the end of a syllable the third radical is either
<lb/>(a) vocalized or (b) elided, whether (i) it stands there naturally
<lb/>as in  خَفِيتُI was hidden, or (ii) after losing a short vowel as in
<lb/>  يَخْفَىhe is hidden for  يَخْفَيُThe following cases arise.
<lb/>a. (i) It is vocalized when naturally so placed, as follows:
<lb/>(a) if the preceding vowel be homogeneous
<lb/>  وْuw becomes  وû as  نَهُوتُI was prudent
<lb/>  يْiy becomes  يi as  غَشِيتI covered
<pb n="46">
<lb/>(b) if the preceding vowel be heterogeneous
<lb/>  وْaw becomes  وْa u as  نَجَوْتُI escaped
<lb/>  يْay becomes  يْai as  هَدَيْتُI directed
<lb/>(ii) It is vocalized if so placed by loss of a short vowel, thus
<lb/>  وْaw becomes  اâ as  عَلَاto be high for عَلَوَ 
<lb/>  يْay becomes  ىa as  جَزَىto reward for جَزَيَ 
<lb/>  وْuw becomes  وû as  يَعْدُوhe transgresses for يَعدُوُ 
<lb/>  يْiy becomes  يi as  يَفْرِيhe cuts out for يَفْرِيُ 
<lb/>b. (i) It is elided when naturally so placed in the imperative and jussive, thus
<lb/>  اُدْعُcall thou (masc.) for  اُدْعُوand  يَدْعُfor يَدْعُو 
<lb/>  اَبْغِseek thou (masc.) for  اِبْغِيand يَبْغِ for يَبْغِي 
<lb/>  اِرْضَbe thou content (masc.) for اِرْضَى  and يَرْضَ  for يَرْضَى 
<lb/>(ii) It is elided when so placed in the nomina agentis (see
<lb/>§ 80) before tanwîn of &ddot;ammaħ and kasraħ, which
<lb/>vowels disappear, while the tanwin passes back to
<lb/>kasraħ of the second radical; thus
<lb/>with forms  فَاعِلٌand  عَاصِوٍُ فَاعِلٍbecome  عَاصٍa striker
<lb/>with forms  مُفَعِّلٌand  مُجَلِّيٌٍ مُفَعِّلٍbecome  مُجَلٍّone who reveals
<lb/>with forms  مُفَاعِلٌand  مُعَادِيٌٍ مٌفَاعِلٍbecome  مُعَادٍone at enmity
<lb/>with forms  مُفْعِلٌand  مُلْقِيٌٍ مُفْعِلٍbecome  مُلْقٍa thrower
<lb/>with forms  مُفْتًعِلٌand  مُعْتَدِيٌٍ مُفْتَعِلٍbecome  مُعْتَدٍtransgressor
<lb/>So with all the first eight forms and tenth (see §§ 236, 311).
<pb n="47">
<lb/>NOTE. The distinction in a (ii) between the final syllables of
<lb/>  علاfor  علو and  جزىfor  جزيis mechanical and not phonetic
<lb/>(see § 7, rem. b).
<lb/>169. Final  وbecomes  ىin all derived forms of the verb,
<lb/>thus II.  عَدَّى , III عَادَى, IV أَنْجى , V تَعَدَّى , VI تَنَاجَى, VII اِنْجَلَى ,
<lb/>VIII اِعْتَدَى etc.
<lb/>170. To form the nomen patientis  مَفْعُولٌof these verbs,
<lb/>radical  وcoalesces with  وof prolongation, as  مَعْصُوٌّstruck with
<lb/>a stick for  مَبْلُوٌّ ، مَعْصُووٌtried for  مَبْلُووٌbut radical  يconverts
<lb/>  وof prolongation into  يand the two coalesce, with kasraħ
<lb/>preceding instead of &ddot;ammah, as  مَهْدِيٌّone led aright for
<lb/>  مَهْدُويٌVerbs like  رَضِيَfor  رَضِوَadmit of either form.
<lb/>171. Doubly weak verbs are of two classes: first those with
<lb/>both hamzaħ and  وor  يamong their radicals; and second those
<lb/>in which  وor ي occurs twice or which contain  وand ي 
<lb/>172. Of the first class there are three sorts, each admitting
<lb/>two varieties according to the position of hamzaħ.
<lb/>(i) Hamzated verbs with initial  وor ي 
<lb/>(ii) Hamzated verbs with middle  وor ي 
<lb/>(iii) Hamzated verbs with final  وor ي 
<lb/>173. In sort (i) hamzaħ serves as middle or final radical, and
<lb/>such verbs are inflected like both classes to which they belong.
<lb/>174. In sort (ii) hamzaħ serves (a) for initial radical, as
<lb/>  آدَfor ءَآدَ  أَوَدَto fatigue,  آلَor  ءَآلَfor  أَوَلَto return; and
<lb/>(b) for final radical, as  سَآءَfor  سَوَءَto be evil,  جَآءَfor  جَيَأَto come,
<pb n="48">
<lb/>  شَآءَ for شَيِءَ to wish. The following table shows such verbs
<lb/>inflected like both classes to which they belong.

<lb/>NOTE. We can write  أُدْتَ ، أُدتَّin accordance with § 14 c.
<lb/>175. In sort (iii) hamzaħ serves (a) for initial radical, as
<lb/>  أَتَىto come,  أَذِيَto be hurt; and (b) for middle radical as نَأَى 
<lb/>to be far.: such verbs are inflected like both classes to which
<lb/>they belong, thus.

<lb/>see § 132, rem. b.
<pb n="49">
<lb/>176. From certain parts of  رَأَىhamzated 'alif may be
<lb/>elided; as (indic. and subj.)  تَرَىthus (masc.) seest,  نَرَىwe see;
<lb/>(subj. and juss.)  يَرَوْاthey (masc) see; but (perf.)  رَأَيْتُI saw,
<lb/>  رَأَوْاthey (masc) saw.
<lb/>REM. c. Radical hamzated 'alif is elided from the fourth
<lb/>form when meaning to show, as  أَرِshow thou (masc.),  أُرِيI show.
<lb/>177. Of the second class (see § 171) there are two sorts.
<lb/>178. In sort (i)  ي، وis the initial and final radical, as وَقَى 
<lb/>to guard,  وَفَىto be faithful to one's engagement,  وَلِيَto be near
<lb/>(see § 142, rem. a); and such verbs are inflected like both classes
<lb/>to which they belong, thus
<lb/>Perf. sing.3rd masc.  وَلِيَ   وَقَى 
<lb/>Perf. sing. 3rd fem.  وَلِيَتْ     وَقَتْ 
<lb/>Perf. sing. 2nd masc.  وَلِيتَ    وَقَيْتَ 
<lb/>Imperf. indic.  يَلِي    يَقِي 
<lb/>Imperative  لِ   قِ 
<lb/>179. In sort (ii)  ي ، وis the middle and final radical, as
<lb/>  غَوَىto go astray  قَوِيَto be strong,  سَوِيَto be even with, equal
<lb/>to  حَيِيَto live; and in such verbs the second radical undergoes
<lb/>no change: thus
<lb/>Perf. sing. 3rd masc. حَيِيَ قَوِيَ غَوَى
<lb/>Perf. sing. 3rd fem. حَيِيَتْ قَوِيَتْ غَوَتْ
<lb/>Perf. sing. 2nd masc.حَيِيتَ قَوِيتَ غَوَيْتَ

<lb/>Imperative اِحْيَ اِقْوَ اِغْوِ
<pb n="50">
<lb/>REM. a. We write  يَحْيَاas above, to distinguish the word

<lb/>REM. b.  حَيِيَmay be contracted to  حَيَّsee § 120.
<lb/>182. The verb  لَيْسَhe is not has no imperfect or imperative;

<lb/>We may perhaps call  لَيْسَa substantive verb, because it implies
<lb/>non-existence without connotation of time or change; it is
<lb/>mentioned in § 442, 559, 560 and 587 d.
<lb/>REM. a.  لَيْسَis compounded of  لاَnot and the obsolete يِسَ 
<lb/>or  أَيْسَexistence, being; as may be learned in studying Hebrew,
<lb/>Aramaic, and Assyrian.
<lb/>183. The verbs of praise and blame are  نِعْمَto be good and
<lb/>  بِئْسَto be bad: they are exclamatory, and when a nominative
<lb/>follows, it must be defined, as  بِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُa bad issue is that!
<lb/>REM. a. The verb may be joined to following conjunctive مَا 
<lb/>as  بِئْسَمَا خَلَفْتُمُونِيevil have ye wrought in mine absence.
<lb/>185. We give here a table of the pronominal suffixes which
<lb/>follow verbs in order to express the accusative, the nominative
<lb/>pronouns having been mentioned in § 89.

<lb/>him off,  يَهْدِيهِمْhe directs them,  اِغْشَيْهِdo thou (fem.) cover it.
<lb/>REM. d. For the older forms  هُمُ، نِيَ، يَand  كُمُsee § 20.
<lb/>186. An accusative suffix causes change to its verb when
<lb/>(a) the word ends with a superfluous 'alif (see § 7, rem. a)
<lb/>which is elided, thus  اِحْذَرُواdo ye (masc.) beware, but اِحْذَرُوهُمْ

<lb/>suffix attached to the word  إِيَّاwhich cannot stand alone;
<lb/>thus  إيَّاكَِthee, but the 1st sing. is  إِيَّايَme.
<lb/>189. A pronominal suffix with  إَيَّاis used,
<lb/>(a) if one desires to avoid attaching two suffixes to the same
<lb/>verb, as  اَعْطَانِيهِ، أَعْطَانِي إِيَّاهُhe gave it to me: also to avoid
<lb/>repetition of the governing verb when a pronoun is coupled by
<lb/>  وَand (see § 578) with a substantive or with a pronominal suffix,
<lb/>as  أَهْلَكْتَهُمْ وَأَهْلَكْتَنِي ، أَهْلَكْتَهُمْ وَغِيَّايَthou hast destroyed them and me:
<lb/>(b) when a pronoun is, for the sake of emphasis, placed
<lb/>before the verb; as  إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإَيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُThee only do we
<lb/>worship and to Thee alone we cry for help (see § 431 rem.).
<lb/>Arabian grammarians divide parts of speech into three;

<lb/>REM. a. Nouns substantive and adjective must be treated
<lb/>together, they being in form almost identical. We give (iii)
<lb/>numerals in §§ 318 to 328; (iv and v) demonstrative, conjunctive,
<lb/>and interrogative pronouns in §§ 340 to 353* : the (vi) personal
<lb/>pronouns, which have been treated in § 84, 89 and 185 to 189,
<lb/>will be mentioned again at § 317.
<lb/>191. In respect of their origin nouns are divisible into
<lb/>(a) primitive and (b) derivative.
<lb/>(a) Primitive nouns are substantives; as  أَرْضٌearth, أُمُّ 
<lb/>mother,  إِنْسَانٌman,  آيَةٌsign, miracle, message, verse,  بِئْرٌa well,
<lb/>  بَدَلٌa substitute,  بَلَدٌcountry, land,  بَابٌgate,  ثُعْبَانٌserpent,
<lb/>  جَبَلٌmountain,  جَسَدٌa body, red gold,  حَجَرُa stone,  حُوتٌfish,
<lb/>  رَأْسٌhead,  رِجْزٌplague,  رَجُلٌa man,  رِجْلٌfoot, زَوْجٌspouse, سِبْطٌ 
<lb/>grandchild, tribe,  سَبِيلٌroad,  سَنَةٌa year,  سُورٌa wall,  الشَّمْسُthe
<lb/>sun,  صَنَمٌidol,  صُورَةٌimage,  ضِفْدِعٌfrog,  طُوفَانٌdeluge, عِجْلٌcalf,
<lb/>  عَصًاa stick,  عَيْنٌeye, spring of water,  فَرَسٌmare, horse,  فُلْكٌark,
<lb/>ship,  قِرْدٌa monkey,  قَسَمٌan oath,  قَلْبٌa heart,  قَمَرٌa moon,
<lb/>  كَلَامٌspeech,  لَوْحٌtable, tablet,  لَيْلٌnight,  مَالٌproperty,  مَآءٌwater
<lb/>(whence  مَاهَto be full of water),  نَفْسٌsoul, self,  نَهْرٌrunnel, rill,
<lb/>  نَهَارٌday,  وَجْهٌface,  يَمٌّsea,  يَوْمٌday.
<lb/>(b) Derivative nouns may be substantive or adjective; and
<lb/>are either deverbal, as  تَفْضِيلٌpre-eminence from  فَضَّلَto regard
<lb/>as superior,  أّدِيبٌlettered, polite from  أَدُبَto be well brought
<pb n="54">
<lb/>up; or they are denominative, as  سُورَةٌa line of bricks, a chapter
<lb/>from  سُورٌa well,  مَسِيحِيٌّChristian from  اَلْمَسِيحُthe anointed, Christ.
<lb/>REM. a. Arabic dictionaries catalogue words under their
<lb/>radical letters; those compiled by Orientals are mostly arranged
<lb/>in order of the final, and by Europeans of the initial radical.
<lb/>All place first the verb, even thought it be derivative and a
<lb/>noun its etymon (i. e. an original, primitive, or root word). To
<lb/>distinguish may be difficult; but any noun which is used as
<lb/>maçdar (see § 195) will best be considered deverbal : thus  إِفْكٌa
<lb/>falsehood beside being a substantive is infinitive of  أَفَكَto
<lb/>beguile, cause to put on a false appearance which has also the
<lb/>infinitive  أَفْكٌLane* gives  بَحْرٌsea, great river, because it is
<lb/>cleft or trenched in the earth, as derivative of  بَحَرَto split;
<lb/>whereas some may wish to regard sea as a primitive noun. It is
<lb/>well to treat substantives of foreign origin as etymons; thus,
<lb/>  صِرَاطٌway from via strata,  جِنْسٌsort, kind from γένος genus,
<lb/>  شَيْطَانٌSatan,  سَبْتٌsabbath,  التَّوْرَاةُthe Old
<lb/>Testament,  الْإِنْجِيلُthe Gospel from εὐαγγέλιον  كُرْسِيَّseat etc.
<lb/>etc. Also we have  الْعَالَمِينَ(plural, oblique case) the mundane
<lb/>rational creatures (see § 302 e). Words which Arabians admit to
<lb/>be borrowed are called by them  مُعَرَّبٌarabicized.
<lb/>REM. b. Arabian grammarians unmethodically divide the
<lb/>nouns into categories which overlap.
<lb/>NOTE. The following defective substantives are primitive
<lb/>* An Arabic-English Lexicon by E. W. Lane. London: Williams &
<lb/>Norgate, 1863 to 1893.
<pb n="55">
<lb/>nouns;  اِبْنٌson,  أَخٌbrother,  اِسْمٌname,  دَمٌblood,  سَنَةٌyear,
<lb/>  لُغَةٌlanguage,  يَدٌhand. Many nouns may be called either
<lb/>deverbal or primitive; thus,  قَرْيَةٌa village,  رِيحٌwind  نَجْمٌa
<lb/>star,  وَلَدٌa child, and  مَنٌّaccording to origin manna or grace, favour.
<lb/>192. Deverbal nouns are divisible into two principal classes:
<lb/>(i) nomina verbi which are by nature substantives, but also
<lb/>serve as adjectives;
<lb/>(ii) nomina agentis and nomina patientis which by nature
<lb/>are adjectives, but also serve as substantives (see § 230).
<lb/>193. The following for sorts of deverbal nouns are connected
<lb/>with the nomina verbi :
<lb/>(i) nomina vicis, that express the doing of an action once;
<lb/>(ii) nomina specici, nouns of kind and manner;
<lb/>(iii) nomina loci et temporis, nouns of time and place (see § 221);
<lb/>(iv) nomina instrumenti, denoting the instrument (see § 228).
<lb/>194. Denominative nouns are divisible into six classes:
<lb/>(i) nomen unitatis, denoting the individual (see § 246);
<lb/>(ii) nomen abundantiæ, denoting a place of abundance;
<lb/>(iii) nomen visis, denoting a vessel ( وِعَآءٌ ) 
<lb/>(iv) nomen relativum which we shall call the relative adjective (see § 249);
<lb/>(v) nomen abstratum qualitatis, the abstract noun of
<lb/>quality;
<lb/>(vi) nomen deminutivum, the diminutive.
<pb n="56">
<lb/>195. Nomina verbi are deverbal nouns, abstract and concrete.
<lb/>The former (known as  مَصَادِرُmaçâdir, plural of  مَصْدَرٌmaçdar
<lb/>source, and as  أَسْمَآءُ الْفِعْلِnomina actionis) are infinitives; the
<lb/>latter are substantives pure and simple. When a noun is maçdar
<lb/>it cannot be used in the plural, and according to some grammarians
<lb/>(see §292 d) is of either gender: in such case it nearly
<lb/>corresponds with the English infinitive and can govern an
<lb/>accusative, which obviously may not be when it appears as a
<lb/>simple substantive. The following verse employs  كِتَابٌin both ways.
<lb/> كَتَبْتُ وَقَدْ أَيْقَنْتُ عِنْدَ كِتَابِهَا 
<lb/> بِأَنَّ يَدِي تَفْنَى وَيَبْقَى كتَابُهَا 
<lb/>I wrote (it) and I felt sure at the time of writing it
<lb/>That my hand would perish and its (the hand's) writing endure.
<lb/>Note. Professor Wright uses the term nomina verbi as
<lb/>synonymous with maçâdir, infinitives and nomina actionis;
<lb/>whereas I require a category wide enough to include all words
<lb/>in the succeeding sections. Without this change the Grammatical
<lb/>Analysis of my First reading book could not have been compiled.
<lb/>196. Nomina verbi from the goundform of triliteral verbs
<lb/>are very numerous. The following specimens will serve our
<lb/>present purpose.
<lb/>1  فَعْلٌas  خَلْقٌcreation,  شَيْءٌa thing.
<lb/>2  فَعَلٌas عَرَضٌ frail goods,  حَالٌstate (see § 207a).
<lb/>4  فِعْلٌ as حِفْظٌ aguarding,  دِينٌreligion, judgment.
<pb n="57">
<lb/>6   فُعْلٌas عُرْفٌ top-knot, an elevated place,  شُحٌّcovetousness.
<lb/>7  فُعَلٌ as هُدًىguidance (see § 212 b).
<lb/>8   فَعْلَةٌas رَحْمَةٌmercy,  رَجْفَةٌconvulsion.
<lb/>9   فَعَلَةٌas a boon,  life.
<lb/>10  فَعِلَةٌ as كَلِمَةٌa word,  نَكِرَةٌignorance.
<lb/>11  فِعْلَةٌ as قِيمَةٌvalue,  فِتْنَةٌtrial,  قِلَّةٌpaucity.
<lb/>12  فُعْلَةٌ as نُسْخَةٌtext,  ظُلَّةٌ canopy.
<lb/>22  فِعْلَانٌ as إِتْيَانٌcoming.
<lb/>23  فُعْلَانٌ as فُرْقَانٌcriterion,  قُرْآنٌreading.
<lb/>25  فَعَالٌ as بَلَاغٌdelivery,  وَبَالٌmischief,  ضَلَالٌerror.
<lb/>26  فِعَالٌ as عِقَابٌchastisement,  لِقَاءٌmeeting,  عِمَادٌsupport.
<lb/>27  فُعَالٌ as خُوَارٌlowing.
<lb/>28  فَعَالَةٌas شَهَادَةٌtestimony.
<lb/>29  فِعَالَةٌ as خِلَافَةٌcaliphate,  قِيمَةٌresurrection.
<lb/>32  فَعُولٌ as رَسُولٌmessage, apostle.
<lb/>37  فَعِيلُ as نَبيٌّprophet (see §17b, rem. b).
<lb/>38  فَعِيلَةٌ as بَيِّنَةٌevidence,  سَيِّءَةٌevil,  مَدِينَةٌa city.
<lb/>39  مَفْعَلٌ as مَرْحَبٌroominess (see Ps. cxviii. 5 [xx x]).
<lb/>40  مَفْعِلٌ as مَصِيرٌreturning, issue,  مَجِيءٌcoming.
<lb/>42  مَفْعَلَةٌ as مَحَبَّةٌlove (see §204).
<lb/>43 [xxx] مَفْعَلَةٌ as مَوْعِظَةٌadmonition, [xxx] مَعْذِرَةٌexcuse.
<pb n="58">
<lb/>Rem. The forms nubered 39 to 43 commence with مَ ma:
<lb/>and if infinitive are called مَصْدَر مِيمِي
<lb/>Note. Beside being feminine of رابِط connector, nomen agentis
<lb/>of its verb, الرَّابِطَةُ the copulative is nomen verbi. Similarly
<lb/>عاقِبَة end is nomen verbi of unusual form.
<lb/>197. Most verbs have only one infinitive(nomen actionis)
<lb/>to their first form, and very few more than two or three apiece;
<lb/>exact information must be obtained from dictionaries.
<lb/>198. When infinitives are few, deverbal nouns (nomina verbi)
<lb/>are very nuerous.
<lb/>No. 1. When infinitives these are from transitive verbs of
<lb/>form فَعَلَ and فَعِلَ We have nomina verbi أجْر reward, أَمْر
<lb/>command, جَمْعassembly, جَمد praise, خَلْف posterity, سَهْل a
<lb/>plain, صَبْر patience, صَدْر breast, عَرْش throne, عَطْف connection,
<lb/>عَهْد covenant, فَصْل separation, قَرْض loan, مَكْر plot, مَهْل gentleness,
<lb/>نَقْض diminution.
<lb/>No. 2. When infinitives these are from intransitive verbs of
<lb/>form فَعِلَ except عَمَل work, rection which is from a transitive
<lb/>verb. For nomina verbi we have أَبَد perpetuity, أَجَلأ fixed term,
<lb/>خَبَر announcement, enunciation, طَمَع desire, عَدَد a number,
<lb/>غَضَب anger.
<lb/>No. 4 has إِذْن permission, إَصْر burden, ذِكْر admonition,
<lb/>سحْر sorcery, ضعْف a like, علْم science.
<lb/>No. 6 has رُشْد true direction, سُوء evil, مُلْك dominion.
<lb/>No. 8. has رَغْبَة desire, كَثْرَة abundance, قِطْعَة a piece, لَفْظَة an
<pb n="59">
<lb/>expression, a word, and جَنَّة a garden by which the ground is
<lb/>covered, from جَنَّ to cover.
<lb/>No. 11 has حِطَّة unloading, ذِلَّة ignominy, قِلَّة paucity.
<lb/>No. 12 has أُمّة a course of acting, one course which people
<lb/>follow in religion, people of a particular religion and so a nation,
<lb/>a people, جُمْلَة an aggregate, a sentence, clause.
<lb/>No. 25 has بَيَان perspicacity, بَيَاض whiteness.
<lb/>No. 26 has كِتَاب writing, a book, حِجَاب obstacle, veil, partition,
<lb/>خِلاَف a contrary, and إله a god which however may be
<lb/>etymon of أَلِهَ to adore.
<lb/>No. 27 expresses sounds, as in the instance given above, viz.
<lb/>خُوَار lowing.
<lb/>No. 29 expresses office etc., as خِلاَفَة the office of خَلِيفَة caliph,
<lb/>successor, وِلاَية governorship, province, حِكَايَة imitation, narration,
<lb/>رِسَالة a message, letter.
<lb/>No. 37 has by form بَشِير herald, وَلِي protector, رَشِيد one
<lb/>who directs, كَلِيم interlocutor, وَكِيل an authorized agent, and
<lb/>سَفِيه a fool which are akin to nomina agentis and may be taken
<lb/>as adjectives of the form فَعِيل
<lb/>No. 38 has خَطِيئَة sin, also written خَطِيَّة see §17, rem. b.
<lb/>199. If a verb has two or three meanings, to be distinguished
<lb/>by characteristic vowels, there may be one or more nouns for
<lb/>each; thus, مَعْرِفة knowledge and عِرْفَان spiritual insight from
<lb/>عَرَف to know; also عِرَافة to become عَرِيف over a people from
<pb n="60">
<lb/>عَرَفَ to be chief, عِرِيف meaning soothsayer or chief; further
<lb/>we find عَرْف sweet smell from عَرِفَ to scent perfume.
<lb/>200. If a verb has more meanings than forms there may be
<lb/>several nomina actionis in correspondence; thus شَفْع a pair and
<lb/>شَفَاعَة intercession from شَفَعَ to double and to intercede.
<lb/>201. Infinitive are used both in an active and a passive
<lb/>sense, there being no separate form to distinguish; thus أَخْذُهُ
<lb/>from أَخَذَ to take means his taking another or his being taken,
<lb/>سَمْع sense of hearing and oral tradition from سَمِعَ to hear.
<lb/>202. The following nomina verbi from derived forms of the
<lb/>strong triliteral verb are also nomina actionis.
<lb/>II تَفْعِيل as تَبْعيض dividing into portions, تَرْكِيب combining,
<lb/>تَعْرِيف definition, تَعْلِيل assigning a
<lb/>cause, تَفْصِيل exposition, تَمْيِيز specification,
<lb/>تَوْكِيد corroboration.
<lb/>III خِطَاب فِعَال a discourse.
<lb/>مُبَالَغَة مُفَاعَلَة exageration, intensiveness, مُغَالَبَة effort
<lb/>to overcome, مُقَارَبَة appropinquation.
<lb/>IV إِسْنَاد إِفْعَال an act of supporting, إِصْلاَح good or ordering.
<lb/>V تَضَرُّع تَفَعُل abasement.
<lb/>VI تَغَابُن تَفَاعُل over-reaching.
<lb/>VII اِنْقِلاَب اِنْفِعَال transition.
<lb/>VIII اِبْتِدَآء اِفْتِعَال beginning, اِشْتِمَال comprehension, اِنْتِقَام vengeance.
<pb n="61">
<lb/>x اِسْتِفْعَال as اِسْتِثْنَآء exception, اسْتِغْفَار an act of asking pardon,
<lb/>استفهام interrogation, استكبار arrogant pride.
<lb/>Rem. In from مُفَاعَلَة is identical with the feminine passive participle.
<lb/>Note. As will be seen from its meaning, the word عَذَاب
<lb/>punishment is connected with the second form, viz. عَذَّبَ to punish
<lb/>(see §41), to which it serves as المَفعُولُ المُطْلَقُ see § 426.
<lb/>204. Nouns derived from verbs with the middle radical
<lb/>doubled observe the rules in § 120; thus غُلَّ fetter for غُلْل
<lb/>حَقّ truth for دَكّ حَقق crumbled soil for رَبّ دَكْك lord for رَبْب
<lb/>مَحَبَّة love or حِطَّة مَحْبَبَة unloading, حِس a sense, عِلَّة a malady, weakness.
<lb/>205. Nouns from hamzated verbs observe the rules in §§ 131 and 135.
<lb/>206. Verbs treated in §§142 and 144 with و as first radical
<lb/>may drop it from the noun and then they add ة by way of
<lb/>compensation: thus, from وَضَعَ يَضَعُ to put down we have وَضْع
<lb/>position and ضَعَة humiliation, from وَصَفَ يَصِفُ to describe is
<lb/>صِفَة a qualificative; while from وَعَدَ يَعِدُ to promise we have both
<lb/>وَعْد and عِدَة which mean a promising, and from وَصَلَ يَصِلُ to
<lb/>reach, attain are وَصْلَة a means of connection and صِلَة a conjunctive.
<lb/>Note. We find the substantive سِنَة drowsiness as well as the
<lb/>infinitive وَسَن a sleeping from وَسِنَ to sleep which makes يَوْسَنُ
<lb/>in the imperfect (see § 143).
<pb n="62">
<lb/>207. Nouns. from verbs with و or ي as middle radical
<lb/>observe the rules in §§150 etc.
<lb/>(a) Those of the form فَعْل remain unchanged, as خَوْف fear,
<lb/>غَيْب secret, فَوْز prize, قَوْلa saying, نَوْم slumber. Those
<lb/>like فَعْل follow §153, as حَال state, condition for حَوَل Those
<lb/>like مَفْعِل most commonly follow § 150, as مَصِير returning, issue
<lb/>for مَصْيِر
<lb/>(b) If و be preceded by kasraħ it mostly becomes ي; as قِيمَة
<lb/>resurrection for قِيَامَة (see § 6, rem. a) for قِوَامَة price for
<lb/>قِوْمَة both from قَامَ to stand.
<lb/>(c) In the fourth and tenth forms the second radical is
<lb/>elided, its vowel passing back to the first, and ة being added
<lb/>to the word's end; thus إِرَادَة wish for إِضَافَة إِرْوَاد annexation
<lb/>for اِسْتِعَانَة إِضْيَاف appeal for help instead of اسْتِعَْوَان
<lb/>210. From these verbs we have nouns of the form فَعْلُولَة as
<lb/>دَيْمُومَة duration from دام to last.
<lb/>212. Nouns from verbs with ي و as final radical experience
<lb/>assimilation into يّ in the form فَعْل if و be the second and
<lb/>ي the third radical thus غَيّ error for غَوْي but we find وّ in
<lb/>قُوَّة force for قُوْيَة of form فُعْلَه When the middle radical is و
<lb/>strong the following rules hold.
<lb/>(a) The third radical is retained if the second bears sukûn, as
<lb/>حَلْي an ornament, دَعْوَة an invocation, خُفْيَة concealment (see §166a).
<lb/>(b) Nouns of the forms فعَل فَعَل and فُعَل are usually written
<lb/>with final ي which is quiescent, while tanwîn falls upon the
<pb n="63">
<lb/>second radical's fat&hdot;aħ; thus هُدًى guidance for حَيُّ هُدَي a
<lb/>tribe from حَوَى يَحْوِي to gather. Sometimes radical و is written
<lb/>ا as also in primitive nouns, thus عَصًا a stick for عَصَو
<lb/>(c) Nouns of the form فَعَلَة with و as final radical may end in
<lb/>صَلَوَة صَلاَة (see §7, rem. d, and compare §294, rem. a).
<lb/>(d) Nouns of the forms فَعال فَعَال and فُعَال change the final
<lb/>radical into hamzaħ, as بَلاَء trial for سَمَآء بَلاَو heaven for سَمَاو
<lb/>لِقَاء meeting for لِقَاي وِعَاءreceptacle for وِعَاي This occurs in
<lb/>nomina verbi of the fourth, seventh etc. forms as اِنْتِهَآء end, limit
<lb/>from نَهَى to forbid.
<lb/>221. Nouns of time and place are formed from the imperfect
<lb/>active of a verb's ground form by substituting مَ for its prefix:
<lb/>the second radical bears fath&dot;ħ or d&dot;mmaħ be characteristic
<lb/>of the imperfect, but kasraħ if kasraħ. Thus شَرِبَ to
<lb/>drink, makes يَشْرَبُ whence مَشْرَب drinking place, كَتَبَ to write
<lb/>يَكْتُبُ whence مَكْتَب place of writing, school, نَزَلَ to descend يَنْزِلُ
<lb/>whence مَنْزِل halting place, صَدَر to proceed يَصْدُرُ whence مَصْدَر
<lb/>the place whence anything proceeds (see § 195).
<lb/>Rem. a. A noun of time and place is called اِسمُ الظَّرْفِ the
<lb/>noun of vessel.
<lb/>Rem. b. A few nouns take kasraħ irregularly, as مَسْجِد place
<lb/>of prostration, a mosque, مَشْرِق time or place of rising, the east,
<lb/>مَغْرِب place of setting, the west, مَسْقِط place where anything falls.
<lb/>222. Nouns of time and place from verbs with و or يas
<lb/>initial radical have kasraħ to the second syllable and always
<pb n="64">
<lb/>retain the first radical; thus مَوْعِد time or place of appointment
<lb/>from وَعَدَ to promise (see § 142), مَوْضِع a place where anything is
<lb/>put down, a place from وَضَعَ to put (see §144).
<lb/>223. Those from verbs with ي و as middle radical experience
<lb/>change in accordance with § 150, thus مَكَان place of
<lb/>existence for مَكْوَن from كَانَ to be, exist.
<lb/>Rem. Verbs with ي as middle radical commonly retain it,
<lb/>thus مِصِير place of returning, مَجِيء place of arrival.
<lb/>224. Those from verbs with ي و as final radical always
<lb/>have fath&dot;aħ (notwithstanding §221) to the second syllable and
<lb/>they suffer the contraction explained in §212 b; thus,مَنْجًى
<lb/>place of refuge for مَنْجَى for مَنْجَو from نَجَا to escape.
<lb/>226. Some nouns of time and place from verbs with ي و
<lb/>as initial radical take the form مِفْعَال (see §228); as مِيقَات
<lb/>appointed time or place from وَقَتَ to fix a time, مِيلاَد time of
<lb/>birth from وَلَدَ to bear a child. In both these examples ي
<lb/>replaces و according to §145
<lb/>227. Those from derived forms are identical in form with
<lb/>the nomina patientis, as مُبْتَدَأ place of beginning, inchoative.
<lb/>228. Nouns of instrument denote the intransitive agent and
<lb/>take the form مَفْعَل or مِفْعَلَة asمِفْتَح and مِفْتَاح a key
<lb/>from فَتَحَ to open. Initial و becomes ي as in § 266, thus
<lb/>مِيثَاق a covenant from وَثِقَ to trust.
<pb n="65">
<lb/>229. We have already mentioned in § 80 the nomen agentis
<lb/>and nomen patientis; they are deverbal adjectives often used as
<lb/>substantives.
<lb/>230. In the ground form nomina agentis are like فَاعِل
<lb/>and nomina patientis like مَفْعُول thus كَاتِب a writer, clerk
<lb/>مَكْتُوب written, script form كَتَب to writer; مَالِك possessor
<lb/>مَمْلُوك owned from مَلَكَ to possess; عَارِف a discerner
<lb/>مَعْرُوف recognized, approved from عَرَفَ to know تَابِع follower
<lb/>مَتْبُوع followed, حَاذِف clipper مَحْذُوف eliminated, حَامِد one who
<lb/>praises مَحْمُود praiseworthy, رَابِط that which binds مَرْبُوط bound,
<lb/>جَامِع that which collects, great mosque مَجْمُوع assembled, جاهِل
<lb/>ignorant, كَارِه hating, حَافِظ preserver, نَاقِص deficient, بَاطِل vain,
<lb/>worthles, بَالِغ on who attains, خَالِد one who stays long, abides,
<lb/>شَارِع manifest, صالِح pious, that which is right, عالِم one who
<lb/>knows, a scholar, كَافِر one who ignores God's benefits an
<lb/>unbeliever, لاَزِم intransitive, وَاقِع falling.
<lb/>NOTE. As regards nomina patientis, we have mentioned in
<lb/>§ 73 the impersonal manner in which passive verbs must often be
<lb/>translated, and shall treat الْمَغْضُوبُ عَلَيْهِم the objects of anger
<lb/>in § 533.
<lb/>232. From the ground form there are other deverbal adjectives
<lb/>of which the following are specimens.
<lb/>1. خَيْر سَهْل فَعْل good, excellent (see § 242, Note 1).
<lb/>2. حَسَن فَعَل good, beautiful.
<lb/>3. أَسِف فَعِل afflicted, نَكِد churlish, صَعِق thunderstruck,
<lb/>swooning.

<lb/>كَبِير great.
<lb/>12. فَعُول شَكور grateful, غَفُور of God forgiving, أَكُول
<lb/>voracious.
<lb/>13. غَضْبَانُ فَعْلانُ angry.
<lb/>14. رحْمَان فَعْلان merciful (a borrowed word).
<lb/>16. أَبْيَضُ أَفْعَلُ white, أَجْمَعُ all (see § 537) yellow,
<lb/>of a horse grey.
<lb/>NOTE 1. We use No 16 to express colours and defects.
<lb/>REM. c. When derived from transitive verbs فَعِيل may have
<lb/>a passive sense; as حَثيِث urged on, swift, حَقِيق fitting, حَمِيد
<lb/>praiseworthy, شَدِيد severe, قَتِيل slain, treated with ku&hdot;l.
<lb/>NOTE. 2. Much of the Corân is almost in the nature of
<lb/>rhymed prose, wherein ون may rhyme with ور ين with
<lb/>ير etc., but the rules are more lax than in classical rhyme
<lb/>prose *; for instance رَحِيم merciful, عَظِيم mighty, عَلِيم skilful,
<lb/>etc. are used to rhyme with مُبِين manifest, رَاحِمِين merciful,
<lb/>سَاجِدين prostrating themselves, مُسْلِمِين Moslems, شَاكِرين thank
<lb/>ful, صَادِقِين truthful, صَاغِرين contemptible, ظَالِمِين wrongdoers,
<lb/>غَافِرِين thos who pardon, غَافِلِين neglectors, غَالِبِين victors,
<lb/>* Specimens of rhymed prose are to be found at pp. 168 to 181 of
<lb/>“Wright's Reading book ” which I hope to reproduce as Elementary Arabic:
<lb/>Third reading book.
<pb n="67">
<lb/>فَاسِقِين impious, قَاهِرُون subduers, نَاظِرِين beholders, and the like.
<lb/>233. Adjectives of form فَعَّال are intensive, as from سَائِل
<lb/>asking we have سَئَّال importunate, a beggar.
<lb/>REM. a. We use this form to indicate occupations, as صَرَّاف
<lb/>a money-changer, قَوَّاس a bow-maker, cavass.
<lb/>REM. b. There are other intensive adjectives, as قَيُّوم ever-lasting.
<lb/>234. The elative, اسمُ التَّفْضِيل the noun of pre-eminence, is
<lb/>of form أَحْسَنُ أَفْعَلُ more or most beautiful.
<lb/>REM. a. When superlative these adjectives must have the
<lb/>article as الْأَرْحَمُ the most merciful, or be in construct state (see
<lb/>§ 475) as أَكْثَرُهُم most of them, and if feminine (see § 295 b) are
<lb/>of form اَلْكَلِمَةُ الْحُسْنَى فُعْلَى the most gracious word.
<lb/>235. No elative should be derived from adjectives which
<lb/>have already the form أَفْعَلُ thus the comparative of أَبْيَضُ white
<lb/>is أَشَدُّ بَيَاضًا stronger as to whiteness: but elatives are sometimes
<lb/>formed, though contrary to strict rule, from the derived forms
<lb/>of verbs.
<lb/>236. Next as to the derived forms in which we have
<lb/>(a) nomina agentis:
<lb/>II مُعَذِّب chustizer, مُفَسِّر explanatory, commentator.
<lb/>III. مُطَاوِع complaint, مُقَارن contemporaneous.
<lb/>IV. مُهْلِك destroyer, مُمْكِن possible, مُجْرِم guilty, مُحْسِن
<lb/>well-doer, مُصْلِح one who puts to rights, مُفْسِد
<lb/>transgressor, مُفْلِح prosperous.
<pb n="68">
<lb/>V مُتَحَرك in motion.
<lb/>VI مُتَشَابِه uniform, i. e. parts resembling part, مُتَقَابِل facing each other.
<lb/>VII مُنْقَلِب one who reverts.
<lb/>VIII مُنْتَقِم avenger, مُسْتَتِر hiding oneself.
<lb/>X مُستكبِر haughty.
<lb/>and (b) nomina patientis:
<lb/>II مُتَبَّر destroyed, مُسَخَّر held in subjection, مُفَصَّل separated,
<lb/>مُقَرَّب brought near, مُحَرَّم forbidden, inviolable, مُقَدَّر
<lb/>ordained, predestined.
<lb/>III مُفَاعَل
<lb/>IV مُنْكَر disapproved, مُسْنَد that which is supported, attribute,
<lb/>مُطْلَق set free.
<lb/>V مُتَفَعَّل
<lb/>VIII مُبْتَدَأ inchoative etc.
<lb/>237. Adjectives derived from verbs with the middle radical
<lb/>doubled observe the rules in § 120; thus ضَال erring for ضَالِل
<lb/>أَشَدُّ stronger or most strong for مُتِمَّ أَشْدَدُ one who perfects for
<lb/>مُضِلُّ مُتْمِم causing error, تَام entire, perfect, كَافّ repulsing.
<lb/>238. Adjectives from hamzated verbs observe the rules in
<lb/>§§ 131 to 135; thus سَائِل one who asks not بَئِس سَاإِل grievous
<lb/>not مُؤْمِن بَإِس believer not مُؤَنَّث feminine.
<lb/>239. Adjectives from verbs with ي و as initial radical
<lb/>observe §§ 147 and 148, thus مُتَّصل joined.
<pb n="69">
<lb/>REM. a. Preceded by kasraħ أ becomes ئ as قَارِئ reader
<lb/>not قَارِأ.
<lb/>240. Nomina agentis from verbs of the first form with و or ي
<lb/>as middle radical substitute for that letter ئ (i. e. hamzaħ and
<lb/>ímâd, see § 16); thus طَآئِر flying, a bird, evil omen from طَارَ
<lb/>to fly and not عَائد طَاير one who returns, نَائم sleeping.
<lb/>241. Nomina patientis from verbs of the first form with و or ي
<lb/>as middle radical, in case of و elide it and throw back its
<lb/>vowel to the first radical; thus مَخُوف to be feared for مَخْوُوف
<lb/>but in case of ي itsf elision must be marked by substituting
<lb/>kasraħ for &ddot;ammaħ, and then و of prolongation becomes ي
<lb/>thus مَدِين one who receives recompense for مَدْيُون
<lb/>REM. Sometimes we find an uncontracted form, as مَدْيُون
<lb/>a debtor.
<lb/>242. Adjectives of form فَعِيل from verbs with ي و as
<lb/>middle radical become فَيِّل and sometimes فَيْل thus, for طَبِيب
<lb/>from طَابَ we have طَيِّب good, sound, agreeable; for بَيِين
<lb/>from بَانَ evident; for بَيِّن from سَوِيء is سَيء
<lb/>wicked; for مَاتَ from مَيِت dead, and for its
<lb/>opposite حَيِي from حَيَّ we have حَيّ living; also for خَيِبر
<lb/>from خَارَ is خَيْر excellent, هَيِن easy for سَيِد هَوْيِن chief, lord.
<lb/>NOTE 1. In § 232 is to be found خَيْر under form فَعْل it is
<lb/>from خَارَ to choose and means to be chosen whence the elative
<lb/>خَيْر مِن choosable rather than, better than: its opposite شَر bad,
<lb/>worse in also used as elative.
<pb n="70">
<lb/>NOTE 2. We may consider بَيِنّة and سَيِئَة (see § 196, No. 38)
<lb/>as substantives derived from the adjectives بَيِن and سَيِء
<lb/>243. Adjectives from the derived form of verbs with و or
<lb/>ي as middle radical follow in respect of it the rules of their
<lb/>Imperfects, thus مُبِين manifest like يُبِينُ IV of بَانَ to be
<lb/>distinct, مُصِيب that which strikes home like يُصِيبُ IV of صَابَ
<lb/>(see § 45, Note), مُضَاف annexed like يُضَافُ IV passive of ضَافَ
<lb/>to incline, مُسْتَقِيم straight like يَسْتَقِيمُ X of قَامَ to stand.
<lb/>NOTE 1. For ضَرْبَة مُصِيبَة a blow that hits we find مُصِيبَة
<lb/>which we may render a mischance.
<lb/>NOTE 2. Be it observed that the nomina agentis and patientis
<lb/>of Form VII are identical, and so with Form VIII.
<lb/>244. We have treated in § 167 b (ii) the nomina agentis of
<lb/>verbsf with و or ي as final radical, and the nomina patientis in
<lb/>§ 170, which last section gives rules applicable to adjectives of
<lb/>form فَعُول and فَعِيل thus عَدُو hostile, an enemy for عَدُوو
<lb/>عَلِي high, sublime for غَنِي عَلِيو rich, self-sufficing for غَنِيي
<lb/>NOTE. In the Corân عَدُو is sometimes a collective noun.
<lb/>245. Adjectives, whose second radical bears fat&sdot;aħ, from
<lb/>verbs with و ي (which we now write ي) as final radical,
<lb/>reject their final vowel.
<lb/>(a) If triptote (see § 308) tanwîn is transferred to the second
<lb/>radical (compare § 212 b); thus مُعْطًى given nomen patientis IV
<lb/>of عَطَا dual, مُعْطَو مُسْتَثْنىً مُثَنًّىan exception.
<pb n="71">
<lb/>(b) If diptote there is only the vowel to reject; thus أَرْضَى
<lb/>better or best pleased for أَرْضَوُ.
<lb/>246. Nomina unitatis nouns of individuality, which specify one
<lb/>from a genus or one part of a whole, are formed by adding بَقَرَة to
<lb/>the collective noun (see §§ 292 a, 306 rem). Thus, بَقَر one head
<lb/>of cattle (ox or cow, ثَوْر being usual for a bull) from بَقَر cattle,
<lb/>ثَمَرَة a fruit from ثَمَر fruit, جَرَادَة a grasshopper, locust from جَرَاد
<lb/>سَحَابَة a cloud from سَحَاب (for سُورَة see § 191 b) ضَلاَلة an error
<lb/>(by some considered nomen verbi, see § 196, No. 28) from ضَلاَل
<lb/>غَمَامَة a cloud from غَمَام قُمَّلَةa louse from قُمَّل lice, لَيْلَة a night
<lb/>from لَيْل night, شَجَرَةً a tree from شَجَر
<lb/>NOTE. We find also سَلْوَاة a quail from سَلْوَى quail.
<lb/>249. The relative adjectives اَلنِّسبَة is formed by adding يّ
<lb/>to the word from which it is derived, and denotes something or
<lb/>person connected therewith. Thus, شَمْسِي solar from الشَّمْسُ the
<lb/>sun, قَمَرِيّ lunar form قَمَر moon, عَرَبِي Arabian from العَرَبُ the
<lb/>Arabs, انْكِلِيزِيّ English from الاْنْكِلِيزُ the English collectively,
<lb/>قَلْبِي mental from قَلْب a heart, شَرْقِي saracen شَرْقِيَّة sirocco from
<lb/>الشَّرْقُ the east, اِسْمِيّ nomina from ظَرْفِيّ اِسْم local from ظَرْف
<lb/>حَالّي circumstantial from فعْليّ حَال verbal from فعْل.
<lb/>250. But the derivatives cannot always be formed so simply:
<lb/>certain terminations are rejected, and other changes arise. Thus
<lb/>مَكَّةُ Mecca أُمَّة مَكِّي (see § 198, No. 12) illiterate, اَلْمَدِينَةُ
<pb n="72">
<lb/>Medina مَدَنِي the Moslems لَفْظَة مُسْلِمِي a word
<lb/>مَعْنًى لَفْظِيّ signification حَقِيقَة مَعْنَويّ reality حَقِيقِي and the
<lb/>Prophet's tribe قُرَيْش makes قُرَشِيّ
<lb/>269. The diminutive is of form فُعَيْل thus حُسَيْن from حَسَن
<lb/>beautiful.
<lb/>289. Nouns substantive must in gender be masculine, feminine,
<lb/>or common, for Arabic has no neuter.
<lb/>290
<lb/>Nouns are said to be feminine (a) by signification, or
<lb/>(b) by from; as,
<lb/>(a) أُمّ a mother, عَجُوز an old woman, مَرْيَمُ Mary, عَيْن an
<lb/>eye, يَد a hand.
<lb/>REM. Masculine are رَأْس a head, and وَجْه a face.
<lb/>(b) بَقَرَة an ox or cow, سُورَة a chapter, جَنَّة a garden, بُشْرَى
<lb/>good news.
<lb/>REM. A few nouns ending in ة are masculine because only
<lb/>used of males, as خَلِيفَة caliph.
<lb/>291. Certain nouns are feminine only by usage; as أَرْض
<lb/>earth, دَار a mansion, رِيح wind, اَلشَّمْسُ the sun, عَصًا a stick,
<lb/>نَفْس a soul, self, نَار fire.
<lb/>292. Many are said to be masculine by form and feminine by
<lb/>signification : together with others, these are of common gender;
<lb/>thus,
<pb n="73">
<lb/>(a) Collective nouns which form nomina unitatis (see § 246)
<lb/>chiefly denoting animals and plants: but سَلْوَى quail is usually
<lb/>masculine.
<lb/>(b) Collective nouns denoting rational beings and not forming
<lb/>nomina unitatis, as خَلْف posterity, مَلَأ chieftains, قَوْم one's
<lb/>people or tribe. But أَهْل and آل one's household, people are masculine only.
<lb/>(d) Deverbal nouns when infinitives (mançâdir, see § 195).
<lb/>(e) Words regarded as such. But كَانَ to be is feminine, as
<lb/>كَانَ التَّامَّةُ the complete kâna (see § 441): so also usually are
<lb/>particles, as أَنِ الْمَصْدَرِيَّةُ the 'an which with its verb is equivalent
<lb/>to a maçdar (see § 488) آنِ الْمُفَسِّرَةُ the explicative' an (see § 367 e),
<lb/>إِنِ الشَّرْطِيَّة the conditional 'in (see § 367 f), إِنِ النَّافِيَةُ the negatives' in (see § 362 k).
<lb/>(f) Certain nouns among which are the following; بَشَر a
<lb/>human being, humankind, حَال state, سَبِيل road, سَمَآء heaven,
<lb/>صِرَاط a way, فُلْك a ship, لَيْل night, مُلْك dominion, هُدًى guidance.
<lb/>293. From most adjectives and some substantive of the
<lb/>masculine gender, feminines are formed ending in ة or ي
<lb/>REM. Of these ة is appended without further change,
<lb/>but feminines in ي and آءُ are distinct in form from the masculine.
<lb/>294. The most usual termination is ة thus, آخِر (for
<lb/>أَاخِر latter, last حَاضِر present قِرد حَاضِرة monkey قِرْدَة she-
<lb/>monkey, مَكِي Meccan مَكِيَّة.
<pb n="74">
<lb/>REM. a A dropped radical may be replaced, as سَموَة from
<lb/>سَمَآء heaven (see § 212 d) : but مُصْطَفَاة (for مُصْطَفَيَة) from
<lb/>مُصْطَفًى chosen.
<lb/>REM. b. ة (see end of § 2 and § 8, rem. a) is a compromise
<lb/>in orthography between the old pausal form ه and ت which
<lb/>we find in رَحْمَت mercy, كَلِمَت word for the more modern رَحْمَة
<lb/>and كَلِمَة. We write أُخْت sister for أَخَوَة
<lb/>295. Feminines ending in ي are derived,
<lb/>(a) from adjectives of form فَعْلاَنُ which make فَعْلَى, as
<lb/>غَضْبَانُ angry غَضْبَى;
<lb/>(b) from adjectives of form أَفْعَلُ when superlative (being
<lb/>defined by the article or following noun, see § 234, rem. a) in
<lb/>which case the feminine is فُعْلَى; as, اَلأَحْسَنُ the most beautiful
<lb/>الأَدْنَى الحُسْنَى the nearest الدُنْيَا (see § 179, rem. a), الأَكْبَرُ the
<lb/>greatest كُبْرَى الْمَدَائِنِ the greatest of the cities.
<lb/>REM. b. The feminine of الأَوَّلُ (for اَلْأَوْءَلُ or اَلْأَأْوَلُ) the first
<lb/>(see § 328) is الأُولَى, and that of آخَرُ (for أَأْخَرُ) other, another is أُخْرَى
<lb/>296. Feminines ending in آءُ are derived from adjectives
<lb/>of form أَفْعَلُ which are not elatives, as أَبْيَضُ white أَجْمَعُ يَيْضَآءُ
<lb/>all جَمْعَآءُ There are feminines which have no masculine, as
<lb/>عَرْبَآءُ most Arab which should come (irregularly, being elative) from أَعْرَبُ
<lb/>297. All adjectives do not invariably employ their feminine
<lb/>forms, and some few have none. Only let the meaning be clear
<lb/>and there may be a laxity as regards form: thus,
<pb n="75">
<lb/>(a) فَعُول is of both genders when active in signification and
<lb/>attached to a singular substantive, as رَجُل شَكُور a grateful man
<lb/>and اِمْرَأَة شَكُور a grateful woman; also when active in meaning
<lb/>and predicate to a substantive or pronoun in the singular, as
<lb/>هِيَ شَكُور she is grateful, ظَنَنْتُهَا صَبُورًا I thought her patient. If
<lb/>however no substantive or pronoun be expressed we must, in
<lb/>order to make our meaning clear, employ the feminine form
<lb/>فَعُولَة as رَأَيْتَ شَكُورَةً I saw a grateful woman, مَا لَهُ حَمُولَة he has
<lb/>not a she-camel to carry loads: also, this is required when the
<lb/>adjectives is passive by signification, as مَا لَهُ نَاقَة حَلُوبَة he has
<lb/>not a she-camel to milk i. e. to be milked.
<lb/>NOTE. Being only used of God غَفُور forgiving has no feminine.
<lb/>REM. a. Exceptions are to be found, as عَدُوّ hostile, an enemy fem. عَدُوَّة
<lb/>(b) فَعِيل is of both genders when passive in signification and
<lb/>attached to a singular substantive, as اِمْرَأَة قَتِيل a slain woman;
<lb/>also when passive in meaning and predicate to a substantive or
<lb/>pronoun in the singular, as هِيَ حَثِيث she is swift, الْعَيْنُ كَحِيل
<lb/>the eye is treated with ku&hdot;l. But if no substantive or pronoun be
<lb/>expressed we must, in order to make our meaning clear, employ
<lb/>فَعِيلَة as رَأَيْتُ قَتِيلَةً I saw a slain woman : also this is required
<lb/>when the adjectives is active by signification; whether transitive,
<lb/>as امْرَأَة عَليمَة a skilful woman, عَجُوز خَبيرَة an experienced old
<lb/>woman; or intransitive, as رِيح عَزِيزَة a powerful wind.
<lb/>REM. Exceptions are to be found in either case; as
<pb n="76">
<lb/>هذَهِ الْفِعْلَةُ حَمِيدَة this way of acting is praiseworthy, and on
<lb/>the other hand رَحْمَةُ اللهِ قَرِيب the mercy of God is near.
<lb/>(c) Similar peculiarities are to be remarked in certain others.
<lb/>NOTE. Adjectives of form أَفْعَلُ when comparative are of common gender.
<lb/>REM. b. Adjectives applicable to females only do not usually
<lb/>from a feminine, as أَنْتِ طَالِق thou (fem.) art divorced because
<lb/>a wife cannot say أَنْتَ طَالِق
<lb/>298. Nouns have (like verbs, see § 81) three numbers, the
<lb/>singular, dual, and plural.
<lb/>299. A dual is formed by adding انِ to the singular after
<lb/>elision of the final vowel or tanwîn; as بَحْر sea أُمَّة بَحْرَانِ a
<lb/>nation أُمَّتَانِ.
<lb/>REM. b. If the singular ends in quiescent ي or which was
<lb/>و the original letter may be restored; as عَصًا a staff عَصَوانِ
<lb/>REM. e. If the third radical has been elided before ة in the
<lb/>singular, it is not restored; thus, لُغَة a language for لُغَوَة makes لُغَتَانِ
<lb/>300. There are two kinds of plurals.
<lb/>(a) That which, having only a single form, is called pluralis
<lb/>sanus, the sound or perfect plural.
<lb/>(b) That which, having various forms, is called pluralis
<lb/>fractus, the broken plural; being more or less altered from the singular.
<pb n="77">
<lb/>301. The sound plural of masculine nouns is formed by
<lb/>adding ونَ to the singular (see § 308), as قَاهِر a conqueror
<lb/>عَابِد قَاهِرُونَ a worshipper عَابِدُونَ The sound plural of
<lb/>feminine nouns is formed by writing ات for ة when they
<lb/>have that termination in the singular, or when without it by
<lb/>adding ات as حَسَنَة a boon ثَمَرَة حَسَنَات a fruit ثَمَرَات
<lb/>طَيّبَة good رَمَضانُ طَيبات the month of rama&ddot;ân رَمَضَانَات
<lb/>REM. a. If the singular ends in 'alif maqçûraħ (see § 7,
<lb/>rem. b) with or without tanwîn (see § 245), as مُصْطَفًى chosen
<lb/>for أَعْلَى مُصْطَفَى higher, highest for أَعْلَىُ; or in kasraħ with
<lb/>tanwîn (see § 167, b ii), as عَمٍ blind for مُفْتَرٍ عَمِي one who
<lb/>invents lies for مُتَّقٍ مُفْتَرِي devout (see § 148) for مُتَقِي or in
<lb/>quiescent ي preceded by kasraħ (see § 314, rem. b), as الْعَمِى the
<lb/>blind (man) for الْعَمِيُ: then § 166 b must be obeyed in the
<lb/>forming of the plurals. Thus,
<lb/>Nominative مُفْتَرُونَ عَمْونَ أَعْلَوْنَ مُصْطَفَوْنَ
<lb/>for مُصْطَفَيُونَ أَعْلَيُونَ عَمِيُون مُفْتَرِيُونَ
<lb/>Oblique مُصْطَفَيْنَ أَعْلَيْنَ عِمِينَ مُفْتَرِينَ
<lb/>for مُصْطَفَيِنَ أَعْلَيِينَ عَمِيِنَ مُفْتَرِيِينَ
<lb/>The singular of اَلْعَمِي illustrates §167 a (ii) in changing from
<lb/>ي iy to ي 1, and the plural differs nothing from that of
<lb/>عَمٍ see § 314, rem. a. Of feminines we may note غَضْبَى angry
<lb/>اَلْكُبْرَى غَضْبَيَات the greatest الْكُبْرَيَاتُ (see § 303 b.).
<lb/>REM. b. Feminine substantives with sukûn to the middle
<pb n="78">
<lb/>radical may undergo change; as أَرض earth قَريَة أَرَضَات a village قَرَيَات
<lb/>REM. c. A final radical dropped as in § 212 c must reappear;
<lb/>thus صَلاَة prayer صَلَوَات (feminine of مُصْطَفى) chosen
<lb/>مُصْطَفَيَات (see § 294, rem. a).
<lb/>REM. d. A final radical dropped before ة sometimes
<lb/>reappears, as سَنَة a year سَنَوات and سَنَهَات but مِئَة a hundred
<lb/>for مِئْيَة makes مِئَات (see § 325, rem. a).
<lb/>REM. e. We have mentioned in § 294, rem. a. سَموَة heaven
<lb/>which makes سَمَاوَات and سَموَات (see § 6, rem. a).
<lb/>302. The sound plural masculine is formed from: —
<lb/>(a) Certain diminutives and proper names.
<lb/>(b) Deverbal adjectives which form their feminines by adding
<lb/>ة as ضَال erring ضَالُّونَ
<lb/>(c) Adjectives of form أَفْعَلُ which are elatives, as أَكْثَرُ
<lb/>more or most numerous أَكْثَرُون also the corroboratives of كُلّ
<lb/>viz. أَجْمَعُ all etc. making أَجْمَعُون etc. (see § 539, rem. a).
<lb/>(d) The relative adjectives (see § 249) as بَدَوِي (irregularly
<lb/>from بَدْو a desert) a badawî بَدَوِيُّونَ badawîn (bedouins). This
<lb/>termination is often shortened to ونَ
<lb/>(e) A few words, among which are اِبْن a son (for بَنَي
<lb/>أَرْض earth أَرَضُونَ one of the four classes of created beings
<lb/>عَالَمُون (see § 191, rem. a) ذُو owner (see § 340, rem. c), etc.
<lb/>REM. a. It must be SPECIALLY NOTED that adjectives have
<lb/>the sound plural masculine only when joined to substantives,
<lb/>expressed or understood, denoting rational creatures.
<pb n="79">
<lb/>REM. b. From substantives and adjectives that have the
<lb/>sound plural masculine there may be formed a broken plural,
<lb/>especially from adjectives used substantively.
<lb/>REM. c. Certain numerals given in § 323 have the form of
<lb/>sound plural masculine.
<lb/>REM. d. Some feminine nouns in ة especially those from
<lb/>which the final radical (ي و ه) has been elided, form a
<lb/>sound plural masculine, the termination ة disappearing; as
<lb/>سَنَة a year سِنُونَ oblique case سِنِينَ
<lb/>303. The sound plural feminine is formed from:—
<lb/>(a) All nouns ending in ة as رِسَالَة message رِسَالاَت
<lb/>آيَة a sign آيَات
<lb/>REM. Some grammarians express this rule less comprehensively.
<lb/>(b) Feminine adjectives, the masculine gender of which has
<lb/>a sound plural, as مُؤْمِنات believing (women) from مُؤْمِن
<lb/>(c) Names of the letters and months, as well as certain
<lb/>other nouns.
<lb/>304. The following are forms of broken plural, from triliteral

<lb/>REM. a. These rules are not without exception nor are they
<lb/>by any means exhaustive.
<lb/>REM. c. Beside عِبَاد br. pl. 5, عَبْد slave has fourteen other
<lb/>broken plurals. When a singular has more than one meaning
<lb/>and several plurals, there may be a correspondence: thus خَلِيفَة
<lb/>a caliph usually follows No. 20 خُلَفَآءُ caliphs, but خَلِيفَة successor,
<lb/>deputy makes No. 17 خَلائِفُ which by rule is restricted to
<lb/>feminines. There are four meanings to عَيْن beside its being the
<lb/>letter's name, and there are four plurals (three broken and a pl.
<lb/>of pl. أُعْيُنَات) of which No. 13 أَعْيُن signifies eyes and fountains.
<lb/>A word which takes the sound plural may have also one or more broken plurals.
<lb/>305. The following are forms of broken plural from singular
<lb/>nouns with four or more consonants.
<lb/>1. فَعَائِلُ plural of quadriliterals, with or without ة in addition,
<lb/>(a) whose four consonants are radical, and (b) formed
<lb/>from triliteral roots by prefixing م ت as
<pb n="85">
<lb/>ضِفدِع a frog مَشْرِق ضَفَادِع the east مَغْرِب مَشَارِقُ the west
<lb/>مَنَارَة مَغَارِب candlestick, minaret مَنَاوِر and مَنآئِرُ (compare
<lb/>§ 240) vulg. مَصْدَر مَنَايِر source مَكْتَب مَصَادِرُ school مَكَاتِبُ
<lb/>2. فَعَالِيلُ plural of quinqueliterals, with or without ة in addition,
<lb/>of which the penult is a letter of prolongation; as
<lb/>مَكْتُوب written مَلْعُون مَكَاتِيبُ accursed كُرْسِيّ مَلاَعِينُ a
<lb/>chair مِيقَات كَرَاسِيُّ (see § 226) مَوَاقِيتُ
<lb/>3. فَعَالِلَة plural of many relative adjectives (see § 249) and other
<lb/>nouns with four or more letters; as
<lb/>مَغْرِبِي a Moor فِرْعَونُ مَغَارِبَة Pharaoh مَلَك مَلأك فَرَاعِنَة
<lb/>angel مَلائِكَة.
<lb/>REM. e. A few nouns have anomalous plurals, as امْرَأَة a woman
<lb/>(see § 304, No. 5 rem.) إِنْسَان نِسَآء a human being أُنَاس; this we
<lb/>may abbreviate to نَاس especially with the article, thus اَلنَّاسُ
<lb/>much as الإِلَهُ has become اللهُ
<lb/>306. We have noted the restriction (§ 302, rem. a) that masculine
<lb/>sound plurals can only be used of rational beings: they
<lb/>are said by grammarians to mean several individuals; whereas
<lb/>the broken plural is by nature a collective and feminine in gender,
<lb/>being generally represented by the feminine singular pronoun;
<lb/>thus كَتَبَْا فِي الأَلْوَاحِ فَخُذْهَا we have written upon the tablets,
<lb/>so take them.
<lb/>REM. Beside broken plurals there are the two sorts of collectives
<lb/>which have been mentioned in § 292 a and b:
<pb n="86">
<lb/>(a) generic nouns (أَسْمَآءُ الجِنْسِ) which form nomina unitatis
<lb/>(see § 246); and
<lb/>(b) nouns to which attaches the idea of collectiveness (أَسْمَآءُ
<lb/>أَشْبَاهُ الْجَمْعِ الْجَمْعِ likenesses of the plural) and which do not
<lb/>form nomina unitatis; as أُمَّة a section of a nation, قَوْم a people,
<lb/>etc, thus مِنَ ألْقَوْمِ أُمَّة يُهْدُونَ of the people there is a section
<lb/>who direct (not which directs) others.
<lb/>NOTE. As nomen verbi أُمَّة appears in § 198, No. 12, and as
<lb/>singular of أُمَم in § 304, No. 1. Beside being nomen verbi (§ 198,
<lb/>No. 25), نَبَات with the signification of plants is a collective, of
<lb/>sort (a) though without nomen unitatis, and makes a plural نَبَاتَات
<lb/>307. In case of nouns which have only one plural there can
<lb/>be no difficulty of selection; but, while the rest are called plurals
<lb/>of abundance, those broken plurals in § 304 numbered 12, 13, 14
<lb/>and 15 as well as the sound plurals, are called plurals of paucity,
<lb/>being used when the objects denoted are ten or less. Thus
<lb/>سَتَّةُ أَيَّامٍ six days br. pl. 14 (for أَيْوَامٍ) of يَوْم a day.
<lb/>308. In Arabic there are three cased, Nominative, Dependent
<lb/>and Accusative, each with its case-ending or sign: we shall
<lb/>however speak of the Oblique case when one and the same sign
<lb/>indicates both Dependent and Accusative. The following tables
<lb/>show how to decline undefined nouns which are not in construct
<lb/>state (see § 313) by means of فَلْس a copper coin, لَيْلَة a night,
<lb/>نُجُوم stars (br. pl. 6 of نَجْم), مُلْكَانِ two dominions, حَسَنَتَانِ
<lb/>two boons, خَالِدُونَ dwellers, طَيِّبَات good things, أَحْسَنُ better,
<pb n="87">
<lb/>بَيْضَآءُ (fem.) white, تَوَابَعُ followers (br. pl. 16 of تَابِع). Nouns
<lb/>ending with ة whether broken plural or singular, make the
<lb/>accusative differently (see § 8, rem. a) from other triptotes, i.e.
<lb/>nouns with three case-endings.
<lb/>TRIPTOTE OR FIRST DECLENSION.
<lb/>Masc. Sing. Fem. sing. Broken pl.
<lb/>Nominative نُجُوم لَيْلَة فَلْس
<lb/>Dependent نُجُومٍ لَيْلَةٍ فَلْس
<lb/>Accusative نُجُومًا لَيْلَةً فَلْسًا
<lb/>DUAL.
<lb/>Masculine Feminine
<lb/>Nominative مُلْكَان حَسَنَتَان
<lb/>Oblique مُلْكَيْنِ حَسَنَتَيْنِ
<lb/>SOUND PLURAL.
<lb/>Masculine Feminine
<lb/>Nominative خَالِدُون طَيِبَّات
<lb/>Oblique خَالِدِين طَيِبَاتٍ
<lb/>Except in the sound plural (see § 302) it makes no difference
<lb/>whether the noun be adjective or otherwise; and so with diptotes,
<lb/>i. e. Nouns with not more than two case-endings.
<lb/>DIPTOTE OR SECOND DECLENSION.
<lb/>Masc. Sing. Fem. sing. Broken pl.
<lb/>Nominative أَحْسَنُ بَيْضَاء تَوَابِعُ
<lb/>Oblique أَحْسَنَ بَيْضَآءَ تَوَابَعَ
<pb n="88">
<lb/>In the dual diptotes and triptotes are alike, thus Nom. أَحْسَنَانِ
<lb/>Obl. أَحْسَنَيْنِ and so in the sound plural.
<lb/>NOTE. For declension of جَوَارٍ see § 312.
<lb/>REM. b. No collquial dialect of Arabic employs case-endings
<lb/>regularly; duals are rare, and in sound plurals only the oblique
<lb/>case is used.
<lb/>309. We call nouns diptote when ending in ي or ٍ
<lb/>such are the following.
<lb/>(a) Broken plurals in § 304 numbered 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23
<lb/>and 24; also those in § 305 numbered 1 and 2; beside a few others.
<lb/>(b) Various nouns, more especially adjectives such as are
<lb/>found in § 232, Nos. 13 and 16, also in §§ 234, 295 and 296;
<lb/>beside others.
<lb/>(c) Many proper names, as مَكَّةُ Mecca; especially if foreign
<lb/>to Arabic, as إسْرَآئِيلُ Israel, دَآءُودُ David, فِرْعَوْنُ Pharaoh,
<lb/>هَرُونُ Aaron, يُوسُفُ Joseph, آدَمُ Adam, إِبْلِيسُ Eblis, مِصْرُ Egypt.
<lb/>Exceptional are such as consist of three letters, the second of
<lb/>which has sukûn or is a letter of prolongation, thus نُوح Noah.
<lb/>REM. e. There are said to be nine reasons why a noun is
<lb/>debarred from taking tanwîn.
<lb/>310.Nouns ending in ا or ي (for و or يء see
<lb/>§§ 212b and 245) have the same form in all three cases;'thus
<lb/>for عَصَو or عَصَوًا we write عَصًا a stick
<lb/>for هُدًى هُدَيًا هُدَيٍ هُدَي guidance
<lb/>Similarly we leave unchanged nouns ending in ي (see § 309)
<lb/>such as غضْبَى (fem.) angry, أَدْنَى nearer, مُوسَى Moses.
<pb n="89">
<lb/>311. With nouns ending in ٍ (for و or ي see
<lb/>§ 167 (ii) and § 369, Table 18) it is somewhat different, for we write
<lb/>دَاعِيًا a preacher as the Accusative of دَاعٍ i. e. دَاعوٍ
<lb/>نَافِيًا negative as the Accusative of نَافٍ i. e. نَافِي
<lb/>مُعْتَدِيًا transgressor as the Accusative of مُعْتَدٍ i. e. مُعْتَدِيٍ
<lb/>أَيْدِيًا hands as the Accusative of أَيْدٍ i. e. ايْدُيٍ (br. pl. 13)
<lb/>following in this the analogy of § 166 a.
<lb/>312. There are however certain broken plurals ending with
<lb/>ٍ which is held to represent يِ They do not follow either
<lb/>of the last two rules; thus جَارِيَة a girl has br. pl. 16 جَوَارٍ in the
<lb/>Nominative and Dependent, but جَوَارِيَ in the Accusative; so
<lb/>also صَحْرآءُ a desert has br. pl. 23 Nom. and Dep. صَحَارٍ, but
<lb/>Accusative صَحَارِيَ.
<lb/>313. Undefined nouns become defined : 1. by prefixing the
<lb/>article اَل the; 2. (a) by adding a defined noun in the dependent
<lb/>case, or (b) by adding a pronominal suffix. While remaining
<lb/>undefined a noun may by put in construct state (see § 475) by
<lb/>the addition of an undefined noun in dependent case.
<lb/>REM. Proper names are in themselves defined, as are the
<lb/>pronouns هُوَ he etc. and words like ذَا this, that (see §§ 340 et seq.).
<lb/>NOTE. A noun cannot have two determinatives; thus الأَعْرَافُ
<lb/>the uppermost parts and أَعْرَافُ الْحِجَابِ the uppermost parts of the partition.
<pb n="90">
<lb/>314. When a noun is defined by the article, the following cases arise.
<lb/>(a) If it be triptote it loses the tanwîn; thus
<lb/>Nominative الفَلْسُ اللَّيْلَةُ النُّجُومُ
<lb/>Dependent اَلْفَلْسِ اللَّيْلَةِ النُّجُومِ
<lb/>Accusative الْفَلْسَ اللَّيْلَةَ النُّجُومَ
<lb/>REM. From the accusative final ا has disappeared along with
<lb/>tanwîn: so also from words like الْأَيدِيَ defined acc. of أَيْدٍ
<lb/>(b) If diptote it becomes triptote; thus
<lb/>Nominative اَلْأَحْسَنُ اَلْبَيْضَاءُ التَّوَابِعُ
<lb/>Dependent الأَحْسَنِ الْبَيْضَآءِ التَّوَابِع
<lb/>Accusative الأَحْسَنَ البَيضَآءِ التَّوَابِعَ
<lb/>(c) If sound plural feminine it loses tanwîn; thus
<lb/>Nominative الطَّيّبَاتُ Oblique. الطَّيِّبَاتِ
<lb/>REM. a. Prefixing the article causes no change in the dual
<lb/>or sound plural masculine.
<lb/>REM. b. From the termination ٍ tanwîn is lost and ي
<lb/>reappears, as اَلْمُلْقِي the thrower from اَلْعَمِي مُلْقٍ the blind (man)
<lb/>from اَلْأَيْدِي عَمٍ the hands from أَيْدٍ
<lb/>NOTE. Nouns ending in ا or ي (for و or ي see
<lb/>§ 310) merely lose the tanwîn, as الْهُدَى اَلْعَصَا
<lb/>315. The following cases arise when a noun is in construct
<lb/>state, i. e. when it is مَضَاف annexed to a noun in the dependent case.
<pb n="91">
<lb/>(a) We decline singulars and broken plurals as if defined by
<lb/>the article; thus
<lb/>Nom. طُلاَّبُ الْعِلْمِ the seekers of knowledge. مَشَارِقُ الأَرْضِ the eastern parts of the earth.
<lb/>Dep. طُلاَّبِ الْعِلْمِ the seeker of knowledge. مَشَارِقِ الأَرْضِ the eastern parts of the earth.
<lb/>Acc. طُلاَّبَ الْعِلْمِ the seeker of knowledge. مَشَارِقَ الأَرْضِ the eastern parts of the earth.
<lb/>NOTE. As to كُلّ all see § 482.
<lb/>REM. a. Certain defective substantives (see § 191, Note)
<lb/>lengthen their final vowel after rejecting tanwîn; thus
<lb/>Nom. أَخُو brother for أَخُ Dep. أَخِي for أخِ Acc. أَخَا for أخَ
<lb/>(b) The dual loses نِ from its termination, as
<lb/>وَلَدَا الْمَلِكِ the two children of the king for وَلَدَانِ
<lb/>بَيْنَ يَدَي رَحْمَتِهَ between the hands of (i. e. before) his mercy for يَدَيْنِ
<lb/>(c) The sound plural masculine loses نَ from its termination, as
<lb/>أَرْسِلْ بَنِي إِسْرآئِيلَ send the sons of Israel for بَنِينَ
<lb/>316. When the noun is defined by a pronominal suffix the
<lb/>following cases arise.
<lb/>(a) Triptotes and feminine sound plurals lose tanwîn, duals
<lb/>and masculine sound plurals the termination نِ or نَ; thus
<lb/>يَدْهَا her hand from عَصَاهُ يَد his stick from كَلِمَاتُنَا our
<lb/>words from يَدَيَّ كَلِمَات my two hands يَدَيْكَ thy two hands from
<lb/>بَالِغُوهُ يَدَيْنِ the attainers of it from بَالِغُونَ
<pb n="92">
<lb/>NOTE. In the Nominative and Dependent we have َيْدِينَا our
<lb/>hands and in the Accusative أَيْدِيًا أَيْدٍ أيْدِيَنَا
<lb/>(b) The singulars, broken plurals, and feminine sound plurals
<lb/>lose their final vowel before ي of me, my (see § 317); thus
<lb/>رَبِي my Lord from أَعْمَالِي رَبّ my works from جَنَّاتِي أَعَمَال
<lb/>my gardens from جَنَّات Having lost its case-endings the noun
<lb/>becomes, so to speak, indeclinable.
<lb/>(c) When a noun ends in ة we use the original form, viz, ت
<lb/>thus آلِهَتُكِ thy gods from آلِهَة
<lb/>(d) When a noun ends in hamzaħ, the 'imâd عِمَاد support
<lb/>(see § 16) is subject to change; thus from نِسَآء we have Nom.
<lb/>نِسَآؤُنَا our women, Dep. نِسَآئِنَا Acc. نِسَآءَنَا and from مَجِيء we
<lb/>have مَجِيؤُكَ thy coming, Dep. مَجِيِئِكَ (see § 17 b).
<lb/>REM. As regards words referred to in § 315, rem a we must
<lb/>note, Nom أَخُوهُ his brother, Dep. أَخِيهِ Acc. أَخَاهُ; but أَخي my
<lb/>brother in all three cases.
<lb/>317. The pronominal suffixes which express the dependent
<lb/>are similar to those given in § 185 except that ي of me, my
<lb/>takes the place of حِفْظُهُمَا نِي the guarding of them both.
<lb/>REM. a. Beside مَعِي along with me we have by reverting to
<lb/>the older form مَعِيَ (see §20 b). When attached to a word
<lb/>ending with و يْ يِ يِ ا or وْ the suffix ي
<lb/>becomes يَ my stick; and in most cases, together with
<lb/>the final letter, it becomes عَلَيَ يَّ upon me (see § 358, rem. a).
<lb/>On أَخ etc. see § 316, rem.

<lb/>REM. b. Like نِي we find ي especially in the vocative,
<lb/>shortened to يَا قَوْمِ O my people for رَبِ قَوْمِي (O) my
<lb/>Lord for رَبّي (see § 438 a, rem. b).
<lb/>REM. c. Changes occur similar to those in § 185, rem. b; thus
<lb/>بِإِذْنِهِ by the permission of him لِنَاظِرِيهِمْ to the beholders of them,
<lb/>عَلَيْهِمْ upon them, بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ between his two hands.
<lb/>318. The cardinal numbers from one to ten are:
<lb/>Fem. Masc.
<lb/>خَمْسَة خَمْس 5
<lb/>سِتَّة سِتّ 6
<lb/>سَبْعَة سَبْع 7
<lb/>ثَمَانِيَة ثَمَانٍ 8
<lb/>تسْعَة تسْع 9
<lb/>عَشَرَة عَشْر 10
<lb/>Fem. Masc.
<lb/>إِحْدَى أَحَد 1
<lb/>وَاحِدَة وَاحِد 1
<lb/>اِثْنَتَان اِثْنَانِ 2
<lb/>ثِنْتَان اِثْنَانِ 2
<lb/>ثَلاَثَة ثَلاَث 3
<lb/>أَرْبَعَة أَرْبَع 4
<lb/>REM. a. For ثَلث and words like it see § 6, rem. a. The
<lb/>radical letters of سدس سِت (see §328, rem. c).
<lb/>319. The cardinal numbers from 3 to 10 take feminine
<lb/>form, when the objects numbered are of the masculine gender;
<lb/>and conversely, the masculine form, when the objects numbered
<lb/>are feminine: as سِتَّةُ أَيَّامٍ six days, سَبْعُ آيَاتٍ seven verses.
<lb/>320. Excepting the duals ثِنْتَانِ اثْنَتَانِ اِثْنَانِ
<lb/>cardinal numbers from 1 to 10 are triptote; ثَمَانٍ standing for
<lb/>ثَمَانِي (see § 311) Accusative ثَمَانِيًا.
<pb n="94">
<lb/>321. Cardinal numbers from 3 to 10 are substantives : either
<lb/>(a) they follow the objects numbered and stand in apposition, as
<lb/>رِجَالٍ ثَلاَثَةٍ of three men i. e. of men, a triad; or (b) they are
<lb/>followed by plural noun in the dependent case, as سَتَةُ أَيَّامٍ
<lb/>six days. For the multiples of 100 see § 325 and § 496, rem. a.
<lb/>REM. When these numerals take the article they lose tanwîn,
<lb/>as also when in construct state or defined by a pronominal suffix;
<lb/>while ثَمَانٍ has. Nom. and Dep. ثَمَانِي Acc. ثَمَانِيَ
<lb/>322. The cardinal numbers from eleven to nineteen are:
<lb/>Fem. Masc.
<lb/>خَمَْ عَشْرَةَ خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ 15
<lb/>سِتَّ عَشْرَةَ سِتَّةَ عَشَرَ 16
<lb/>سَبْعَ عَشْرَةَ سَبْعَة عَشَر 17
<lb/>ثَمَانِيَ عَشْرَةَ ثَمَانِيَةَ عَشَرَ 18
<lb/>تسْعَ عَشْرَةَ تسْعَةَ عَشَرَ 19
<lb/>Fem. Masc.
<lb/>إِحْدَى عَشْرَةَ أَحَدَ عَشَرَ 11
<lb/>اِثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ اِثْنَا عَشَرَ 12
<lb/>ثِنْتَا عَشرَةَ اِثْنَا عَشَرَ 12
<lb/>ثَلاَثَ عَشْرَةَ ثَلاَثَةَ عَشَرَ 13
<lb/>أَرْبَعَ عَشْرَةَ أَرْبَعَةَ عَشَرَ 14
<lb/>REM. a. We fund ثَمَانِ عَشْرَةَ and other forms ثَمَانِيَ عَشْرَةَ
<lb/>REM. b These cardinal numbers are followed by th objects
<lb/>numbered in the accusative singular (see § 444, e, rem. b).
<lb/>REM. c. These numerals may be called indeclinable, except
<lb/>اِثْنَتَا ثِنْتَا عَشْرَةَ اِثْنَا عَشَرَ which have an oblique case
<lb/>اِثْنَيْ غَشَرَ and اِثْنَتَيْ ثِنْتَيْ عَشْرَةَ
<lb/>REM. d. Since long ago these compound numerals suffered
<lb/>contraction into one word, and are further corrupted in colloquial dialects.
<pb n="95">
<lb/>323. The cardinal numbers from twenty to ninety are:
<lb/>ثَمَانُونَ 80 سِتُّون 60 أَرْبَعُونَ 40 عِشْرُونَ 20
<lb/>تِسْعُون 90 سَبْعُون 70 خَمْسُونَ50 ثَلاَثُونَ 30
<lb/>REM. a. For ثَمنُونَ ثَلثُونَ see § 6, rem. a.
<lb/>REM. b. While of common gender these numerals are declined
<lb/>as masculine sound plurals, taking an oblique case in ينَ
<lb/>thus أَرْبَعِينَ ثَلاَثِينَ عِشْرِينَ etc. They are subjunctives and
<lb/>usually take after then the objects numbered in the accusative
<lb/>singular (see § 499).
<lb/>324. Numeral compounded of units and tens require وَ and
<lb/>between the unit and the ten; thus Nom. تِسْع وَخَمْسُونَ nine
<lb/>and fifty, fifty nine, Dep. تِسْعًا وَخَمْسِينَ تِسْعٍ وَخَمْسِينَ
<lb/>325. The multiples of مِائَة one hundred are as follows:
<lb/>200 مِائَتَانِ, 300 ثَلاَثُ مِائَةٍ, 400 أَرْبعُ مِائَةٍ, etc.
<lb/>REM. a. For مِائَة we way write مِئَة and (see § 17 b, rem. b)
<lb/>مِيَة which last represents the usual pronunciation. There are
<lb/>other plurals beside the one mentioned in § 301, rem. d.
<lb/>326. The multiples of أَلْف one thousand are as follows:
<lb/>2000 اَلْفَان, 3000 ثَلاثَةُ آلافٍ, 4000 ارْبَعَةُ آلافٍ, etc.
<lb/>REM. There are other plurals of آلاف أَلْف
<lb/>328. The ordinal numbers are adjectives; thus, masc. الأَوَّلُ
<lb/>fem. الأُولَى the first, masc. ثَانِيَة ثَانٍ second, masc. ثَالِت
<lb/>fem. ثَالِثَة third, masc. رَابِع fourth, etc.
<pb n="96">
<lb/>REM. a. The radinal letters of اَلْأَوَّلُ (see § 295, rem. b) and
<lb/>اَلْأُولَى (for اَلْأُوْلَى or اَلْوُؤْلَى) are أول or وأل. These words have
<lb/>plurals, and will be further treated in § 486, rem. a, and § 493.
<lb/>REM. c. From masc. سَادِسَة سَادِس sixth we can obtain
<lb/>the radical letters of سِت given in § 318, rem. a, as also from
<lb/>the fraction سُدْس a sixth part.
<lb/>340. The simple demonstrative pronoun is ذَا this, that, which
<lb/>in course of declension takes many forms, the commonest plural
<lb/>being, masc. أُلَآءِ أُلَى these, those.
<lb/>REM. c. Closely connected by origin with ذَا is ذُو possessor,
<lb/>which is also declined, making in the singular feminine Nom.
<lb/>ذَاتَ ذَاتِ ذَاتُ none of which is found except in
<lb/>construct state (see § 475).
<lb/>REM. d. By prefixing كَ like to ذَا we get كَذَا thus, so and
<lb/>so, see § 362 bb.
<lb/>341. From the simple demonstrative pronoun compounds,
<lb/>which admit of declension, are formed (a) by appending كِ كَ
<lb/>كُنَّ كُمْ كُمَا either (i) alone, or (ii) with لِ interposed; also
<lb/>(b) by prefixing هَا.
<lb/>a (i) ذَاكَ that is used whatever sex or number of persons
<lb/>addressed, but we may say to a women ذَاكِ to two persons
<lb/>ذَاكُمَا etc. The plurals أُلاَكَ and أُلَآئِكَ and أُولاَئِكَ with short
<lb/>first syllable, those are of common gender.
<lb/>(ii) Similarly ذلِكَ ذَالِكَ that is used in conjunction with
<pb n="97">
<lb/>pronominal suffixes of the second person; thus فِي ذَلِكُمْ therein
<lb/>O you.
<lb/>REM. By prefixing كَذلِكَ ذَلِكَ كَ in like
<lb/>manner, so, see § 463.
<lb/>b. The particle هَا (which is also an interjection, see §368)
<lb/>we may prefix to ذَا and write هذَا this, which word has a
<lb/>singular feminine هذِهِ and as one of its plurals هَؤْلاءِ هَاؤُلاَءِ
<lb/>these of common gender.
<lb/>345. We find in Arabic only one article, viz, اَلْ which is
<lb/>called the instrument of definition and always written in conjunction
<lb/>with the following word; thus قُرْآن a reading الْقُرآنُ
<lb/>the reading, the Corân.
<lb/>REM. a. The article is also called لَامُ التَّعْرِيِف ('alif being
<lb/>merely prosthetic, see § 19, rem. c) the lâm of definition, and it
<lb/>has two uses:
<lb/>(i) لَامُ الْعَهْدِ the article of familiarity when its presence
<lb/>implies that the word, to which it is attached, expresses a thing
<lb/>or person known to the hearer; thus يَرِثُونَ الأَرْضَ they shall
<lb/>inherit the earth, i. e. the earth which we know:
<lb/>(ii) لَامُ الْجِنْسِ the generic article, not implying that the
<lb/>word, to which it is prefixed, expresses an individual person or
<lb/>thing; in this case it shows the genus by indicating one member
<lb/>of a class; thus فَلِأُمِهِ السُدْسُ his mother shall have a sixth,
<lb/>إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمُ الْحَسَنَةُ whenever a boon comes to them.
<lb/>NOTE. Arabic and some other languages are more regular
<lb/>than English in respect of the generic article, for one says “Man
<pb n="98">
<lb/>is mortal” but “The horse is a quadruped,” whereas in these
<lb/>cases we must write اَلْإِنسَانُ l'homme and الْفَرَسُ le cheval (see
<lb/>§ 527).
<lb/>346. Among the conjunctive pronouns are masc. اَلَّذِي fem.
<lb/>اَلَّتِي who, which that مَنْ he who, she who, whoever; مَا that
<lb/>which, whatever. They are also called relative pronouns and,
<lb/>with exception of اَلَّذِي may be interrogative (see § 351).
<lb/>347. As may be found in § 20 b, initial اَلَّذِي ال represents
<lb/>the article. to which is joined ل (see § 341 a ii) and ذَا or ذُو
<lb/>(see § 340). Of the many forms taken in declension we must,
<lb/>beside اَلَّتِي the feminine singular, mention the masculine plural
<lb/>اَلَّذِينَ When used adjectivally these words refer to definite
<lb/>substantive with which they agree in gender, number, and case;
<lb/>thus اللهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَهُ God who created it الأَرْضُ الَّتِي بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا
<lb/>the land which We blessed: when used substantively however
<lb/>they have the meaning of أغْرَقْنَا الَّّذِينَ مَا مَنْ 
<lb/>drowned those who.
<lb/>REM. The nominatives must originally have been اَللَّذُو and
<lb/>اَللَّذُونَ but in place of these words the oblique case is always
<lb/>used (see § 308, rem. b) and a shortened form.
<lb/>348. The conjunctive pronouns مَا مَنْ are indeclinable:
<lb/>the former refers to beings endowed with reason, as مُوسَى وَمَنْ
<lb/>مَعَهُ Moses and those who (are) with him; while the latter is used
<lb/>of all other objects, as بِمَا فَعَلَ by reason of that which he has
<lb/>done. Unlike اَلَّذِي these words can never be used adjectivally.
<pb n="99">
<lb/>351. All conjunctive pronouns may be interrogative except
<lb/>مَنْ أَنْتِ اَلَّذِي who art thou? مَا فَعَلَ what has he done?
<lb/>see §570.
<lb/>REM. The interrogative مَا is usually shortened to مَ when
<lb/>joined with a preposition, thus لِمَ why? i. e. because of what?
<lb/>So also كَمَا the like of what? becomes كَمْ how much?
<lb/>353*. The pronouns مَا مَنْ are sometimes indefinite. Of
<lb/>this sort is مَا الْمَصْدَرِيَّةُ the mâ which introduces a clause equivalent
<lb/>to a ma&cdotdar (see §§ 488 and 514); thus مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جِئْتَ
<lb/>after that thous camest which is equivalent to مَنْ بَعْدِ مَجِيئكَ
<lb/>after thy coming. We find the indefinite مَا in conditional clauses
<lb/>مَا الشَّرْطِيَّة § 406), also in reference to time مَا الدَّيْمُومَةِ §§ 367 p
<lb/>and 407); when added to certain adverbs it gives them a
<lb/>conditional and general signification, thus حَيْثُ where حَيْثُمَا
<lb/>wherever. أَيْنَ where أَيْنَمَا wherever. If appended to أَنَّ إِنَّ
<lb/>etc. it hinders their regimen (مَا الْكَافَّةُ § 436, rem. d); attached
<lb/>to a conjunction or preposition مَا الزَّائِدةُ § 470, rem. f) it
<lb/>usually does not; and there are other uses for which it serves.
<lb/>Note. Similar to the adverbs mentioned above is مَهْمَا (for
<lb/>مَامَا) whatever from مَا what.
<lb/>354. The particles are of four sorts; viz. prepositions,
<lb/>adverbs, conjunctions, and interjections.
<lb/>355. The prepositions are divided into separable, i. e. those
<lb/>written as separate words, and inseparable, i. e. those which are
<lb/>united in writing with the following word.
<pb n="100">
<lb/>356. The inseparable prepositions consist of one consonant
<lb/>with its vowel. They are : —
<lb/>(a) بِ by, by means of, by reason of, for the reason, in, on, with,
<lb/>to, of, in exchange for, see § 456.
<lb/>(c) لِ belonging to, for the use of, to, due to, in, for, of see § 453,
<lb/>by in swearing, see § 462.
<lb/>rem. b, as بِهِم بِهِ see also § 20, rem. a.
<lb/>REM. b. Before a pornominal suffix the preposition لِ becomes
<lb/>لَكُمْ لَهُ لَ etc.; except with ي me when we have لِي
<lb/>REM. c. Sometimes كَ like is reckoned among prepositions:
<lb/>it will be treated in § 463.
<lb/>357. The separable prepositions are of two sorts : firstly,
<lb/>those which have different terminations and are biliteral or triliteral;
<lb/>secondly, those which are substantives in the accusative
<lb/>singular and end in َ having lost tanwîn on account of the
<lb/>following noun (see § 478 b).
<lb/>358. The separable prepositions of the first sort are :—
<lb/>(a) إِلَى to towards, until, see § 451.
<lb/>(b) حَتَّى till, up to, see § 452.
<lb/>(c) عَلَى over, upon, against, to, for on account of, concerning,
<lb/>by means of, incumbent upon, see § 459.
<lb/>(d) عَنْ from, away from, of, see § 449.
<lb/>(e) فِي in, into, over, among, upon, on, concerning, treating of,
<lb/>see § 455.
<lb/>(f) لَدَى لَدُنْ with, beside, near.
<pb n="101">
<lb/>(g) مَعْ with, along with, see § 457.
<lb/>(h) مِنْ of, to, from, on, out of, see § 20 d and § 448.
<lb/>(i) مُذْ مُنْذُ from a certain time, since.
<lb/>REM. a. Before suffixes the final syllables of عَلَى إلَى and
<lb/>لَدَى are diphthongs; thus إِلَيْكَ to thee, عَلَيْنَا over us. Changes
<lb/>occur similar to those in § 185, rem. b; إِلَيْهِنَّ to them (fem.),
<lb/>عَليهما over them both. With إِلَى me we have إلَى to me etc.,
<lb/>and فِي in case of فِي as كِتَاب فِيَّ a letter relating to me (see
<lb/>§ 317, rem. a).
<lb/>REM. b. In connection with ي we double the عَنْ ن
<lb/>مِنْ and لَدْن thus مِنِّي from me. The ن and مِنْ is
<lb/>assimilated in connection with مِنْ or مَا thus عَتَوْا they
<lb/>turned disdainfully from that which for عَنْ مَا (see § 14 b, rem. b).
<lb/>359. Separable prepositions of the second sort have been
<lb/>described in § 357 and will be noticed in § 444 b. Among them
<lb/>are بَعْدَ after, بَيْنَ between, تَحْتَ under, خَلْفَ behind, دُونَ below,
<lb/>عِنْدَ beside, in the mind of, فَوْقَ above, over, قَبْلَ before of time
<lb/>(see § 464 to 470).
<lb/>360. The adverbs are of three sorts; firstly, particles some
<lb/>inseparable and some separable; secondly, indeclinable substantives
<lb/>ending in و thirdly, nouns in the accusative.
<lb/>361. The inseparable adverbial particles are :—
<lb/>(a) أَ interrogative, see § 566.
<lb/>REM. When this أَ is followed by إِ we use ي instead of ا
<pb n="102">
<lb/>as 'imâd (see § 16) to hamzaћ and write the two thus أَيِ as
<lb/>أَئِنَّ لَنَا لَأَجْرًا shall there indeed be to us a reward ?
<lb/>(b) سَ (abbreviation of سَوْفَ see § 364 e) prefixed to a verb in
<lb/>the imperfect to express more emphatically its future sense.
<lb/>(c) لَ verily, surely, certainly (see § 590). As لَئِنْ كَشَفْتَ عَنَّا
<lb/>الرجزَ لَنُؤْمِنَن لَكَ وَلَنُرْسِلَن Verily if thou removest from
<lb/>us the plague, surely we will believe with thee, and we will
<lb/>certainly send. This la is always affirmative, and of it
<lb/>there are said to be five sorts.
<lb/>362. Among the separable adverbial particles are :
<lb/>(b) إذْ and إِذَا behold! Lo! Of these إِذَا is followed only by a
<lb/>nominal proposition (see § 513) and refers to the same
<lb/>time as the preceding statement.
<lb/>(e) أَلاَ truly, see § 568.
<lb/>(k) إِنْ not, called إنِ النَّافِيَةُ the negative 'in, see § 558.
<lb/>(m) إنَّ verily precedes a noun in the accusative or one of the
<lb/>pronominal suffixes given in § 185; but the 1st singular
<lb/>can be إِنَنِي or إِني and the 1st plural إَنَنا or إَنَّا In such
<lb/>case the suffix هُ may be ضَميرُ الشَّأنْ the pronoun of the
<lb/>fact, not being needed to express the sentence's meaning,
<lb/>thus إِنَه أَنَا اللهُ verily I am God (see § 367 g). By means
<lb/>of إِنَّ the subject may be introduced, upon which often follows
<lb/>a predicate with لَ (see § 361 c) as إنَّ هذَا لَسَاحِر عَلِيم
<lb/>verily this (man) is a skilled magician. For government
<lb/>by إَنَّ see § 436.
<pb n="103">
<lb/>(n) إِنَّمَا only, see § 436, rem. d, and § 585.
<lb/>(q) إِي yes, yea; used with an oath, as إِي وَاللهِ yes by God,
<lb/>whence the vulgar أَيْوَا and in Nubia أَيْوَلْ for which at
<lb/>Damascus اي نعم is said.
<lb/>(s) أَيْنَمَا where? أَيْنَ wherever, see § 353*.
<lb/>(u) بَلَى yes, yea sometimes to be translated on the contrary, for
<lb/>to a negative statement it gives contradiction. Compare
<lb/>si in French.
<lb/>(z) قَدْ is usually employed with the perfect (see § 402, 403 b)
<lb/>to express more emphatically its past sense: when used
<lb/>with the imperfect we render قَدْ sometimes.
<lb/>(bb) كَذَا thus (§ 340, rem. d) and كَذلِكَ in like manner
<lb/>(see § 341 a, rem.).
<lb/>(dd) لاَ not is used: —
<lb/>(i) as negative of the future and of the indefinite present,
<lb/>see §§408 e, rem. a, 439, 555, and 584 a;
<lb/>(ii) as representative of the other negatives after وَ and,
<lb/>see § 482 d rem., 560, and 580;
<lb/>(iii) as negative of the jussive, see § 417 b and 420.
<lb/>(ee) لكِنْ لكِنَّ often with وَ prefixed but, yet (see § 584 b). We
<lb/>place لِكنَّ only before nouns and pronominal suffixes in
<lb/>the accusative case (see § 436). With the 1st person we
<lb/>may write لِكنَّا لكِنِّي as well as لكِنَّنَا لكِنَّنِي
<lb/>(ff) لَمْ not is used solely with the jussive which is then perfect
<lb/>in sense, see §§ 412 and 418.
<pb n="104">
<lb/>(gg) لَمَا not yet, joined to the jussive.
<lb/>(hh) لَنْ not a contraction of لاَ أَنْ (i. e. لَا يَكُونُ أَنْ it will not be
<lb/>that) is followed by the subjunctive, see §§ 411, 415 a i,
<lb/>and 556.
<lb/>(kk) مَا not negative of the definite or absolute present, see
<lb/>§§ 408 e, rem. a, and 531; also the past see § 557.
<lb/>(mm) نَعَمْ yes, yea (for نِعَمَ it is agreeable) affirms the preceding statement.
<lb/>(oo) هَلْ interrogative, see § 567.
<lb/>(qq) هُنَا demonstrative here; whence (see § 341for an analogy)
<lb/>هُنَالِكَ there.
<lb/>363. We have treated in §§ 357 and 359 certain accusative
<lb/>substantives which serve as prepositions; the same nouns may
<lb/>be used as adverbs, but they must invariably end in و. Thus
<lb/>مِنْ بَعدُ بَعْدُ afterwards; حَيْثُ where, مِنْ حَيْثُ whence,
<lb/>إِلَى حَيْثُ whither, حَيْثُمَا wherever (see §§353* and 406);
<lb/>مِنْ قَبْلُ قَبْلُ beforehand.
<lb/>364. The Arabic language would however be poor in adverbs
<lb/>but for the adverbial accusative, which is extensively used as will
<lb/>be learned from § 440 et sqq. Here we may mention أَبَدًا ever,
<lb/>جَمِيعًا all together. Also, of the same class are the adverbs:—
<lb/>(e) سَوْفَ in the end prefixed to the imperfect to express real
<lb/>futurity, see §§ 361 b, 408 c, and 587 d.
<lb/>(g) كَيْفَ how?
<lb/>REM. b. For لَعَلَّ see §§ 436, rem. f, and 442, rem. g (2).
<pb n="105">
<lb/>365. The conjunctions, like prepositions and adverbs, are
<lb/>some inseparable and some separable.
<lb/>366. The inseparable conjunction are :—
<lb/>(a) وَ and, see §§ 576 to 583.
<lb/>(b) فَ so, and so, so that, and thereupon, then, see §§406 c,
<lb/>415 d, 540, 576, and 587.
<lb/>REM. These conjunctions وَ and فَ may be preceded by the
<lb/>interrogative أَ (see § 566).
<lb/>(c) لِ This may be (i) the li of command (see 417 a) which is
<lb/>usually prefixed to be the 3rd sing. of the jussive, to give it
<lb/>an imperative sense; and when following ف is
<lb/>written without kasraћ thus لْ : or (ii) the li which
<lb/>governs the subjunctive and means that, so that, in order
<lb/>that (see §§ 411 and 415 b).
<lb/>367. Among the separable conjunctions are these:—
<lb/>(a) إِذْ when is prefixed to a verbal or nominal preposition and
<lb/>refers to the past; thus وَإِذْ أَنْجَيْنَاكُمْ and (remember the
<lb/>time) when We delivered you.
<lb/>(b) إِذَا whenever, see § 405.
<lb/>(d) أَمَّا followed by فَ as for, as regards, see § 576.
<lb/>(e) أَنْ that, so that, in order that governs the subjunctive
<lb/>(see §§ 411 and 415 a i); also the perfect and indicative
<lb/>(see § 415 a ii) : it is used after certain prepositions
<lb/>(see §§ 470, rem. f, and 488). Notice must here be taken
<lb/>of أَنِ الْمُفَسِرَةُ the explicative 'an, which introduces a
<pb n="106">
<lb/>quotation, as أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَى مُوسَى أَنْ أَلْقِ عَصَاكَ We revealed
<lb/>to Moses (saying) Throw down thy rod.

<lb/>that thou dost throw or that we be the throwers.
<lb/>(g) أَنَّ that. Like إِنَّ it precedes a noun in the accusative or
<lb/>one of the pronominal suffixes given in § 185; the 1st

<lb/>In such case the suffix هُ may be pronoun of the fact (see
<lb/>§ 362 m) as بِأَنَّهُ كَانَتْ تَأْتِيهِمْ رُسُل because apostles used
<lb/>to come to them. Beside بِأَنَّ we have لِأَنَّ which also
<lb/>means because, and كَأَنَّ as though, see §§ 436 and 470, rem. f.

<lb/>SYNTAX.
<lb/>[From section numbers below there must be subtracted 400, in order to ascertain
<lb/>the corresponding section of Wright's Arabic Grammar, vol. ii]
<lb/>401. We have observed in § 77 that an Arabic verb has two
<lb/>States: of these the Perfect indicates, —
<lb/>(a) and act completed at some time past, as نَزَعَ مُوسَى يَدَهُ
<lb/>Moses plucked out his hand;
<lb/>(b) an act which has been already completed at the moment
<lb/>of speaking, and remains so, thus أَغَيْرَ اللهِ أَبْغِيكُمْ إِلهًا وَهُوَ فَضَّلَكُمْ
<lb/>عَلَى الْعَالَمِينَ shall I seek for you and abject of worship other than
<lb/>God, seeing that He has favoured you above all creatures?
<lb/>(c) a past action which still continues, as وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَوَاتِ
<lb/>His throne comprises the heavens, مَا أَصَابَ مِنْ مُصِيبَةٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللهِ
<lb/>no mischance befalls except by permission of God;
<lb/>(d) an act just completed at the moment of speaking, as
<lb/>تُبتُ إِلَيك I repent toward Thee;
<lb/>(e) in treaties, promises, bargains and the like and act which,
<lb/>though future, is quite certain;
<lb/>(f) something desired, as رَحِمَهُ اللهُ God have mercy upon
<lb/>him, صَلى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ God bless him and grant him peace.
<pb n="136">
<lb/>REM. Europeans translate تَبَارَكَ اللهُ رَبَّ العالَمِينَ blessed be
<lb/>God the Lord of all creatures, but the verb is declarative (see § 50, rem. a).
<lb/>402. The perfect is often preceded by قَدْ (see § 362 z) to add
<lb/>assurance of completeness; which may lie
<lb/>(a) in certainty, as قَدْ أَرْسَلْنَا نُوحًا We sent Noah, فَانْبَجَسَتْ
<lb/>مِنْهُ اثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ عَيْنًا قَدْ عَلِمَ كُلُّ أُنَاسٍ مَشْرَبَهُمْ so from it twelve
<lb/>springs gushed, every tribe assuredly their drinking-place; or
<lb/>(b) in being expected or contrary to expectation, as قَد جِئْتُكُمْ
<lb/>بِبَيِّنَةٍ I have brought you evidence.
<lb/>NOTE. If preceded by affirmative لَ (see § 361 c) the influence
<lb/>of قَدْ is in no way affected.
<lb/>403. The pluperfect is expressed, —
<lb/>(a) by the simple perfect in a relative or conjunctive clause*
<lb/>which depends upon a clause in which the verb is perfect; thus
<lb/>تمت كلمت ربك الحسنى على بني اسرائيل بما صبروا the most
<lb/>gracious word o thy Lord was fulfilled to the sons of Israel by
<lb/>reason o what they had endured; فلَمَا أَلْقَوا سَحَروا أعين الناسِ
<lb/>so when they had cast, they bewitched men's eyes;
<lb/>(b) by the perfect and قَدْ with or without قَدْprovided the
<lb/>preceding clause has its verb in the perfect, as وَلَما رَاوْا أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ
<lb/>ضلُّوا and when they saw that they had erred;
<lb/>(c) by كَانَ to be prefixed to the perfect;
<lb/>* A relative or conjunctive clause is one coupled to its ruling clause
<lb/>by a relative pronoun or connective particle.
<pb n="137">
<lb/>(d) by كَانَ and the perfect, with قَدْ interposed, or prefixed.
<lb/>404. (a) when two correlative clauses follow لَوْ if (see §§ 3670
<lb/>and 588) or any similar hypothetical particle, perfect verbs in
<lb/>both clauses may correspond with the English pluperfect subjunctive;
<lb/>as لَوْ شِئْتَ أَهْلَكتَهُمْ مِنْ قَبْلُ if Thou hadst wished
<lb/>Thou wouldst have destroyed them beforehand.
<lb/>405. After إِذَا whenever, as often as (see 367 b) a perfect is
<lb/>said to take the imperfect's meaning; and perfect verbs in two
<lb/>correlative clauses have either a present or future signification,
<lb/>provided the first clause extends its conversive influence to the
<lb/>verb of the second; thus فَإِذَا جَآءَتْهُمُ and
<lb/>whenever a boon comes to them they will say, say This (boon) is due
<lb/>to us. Sometimes إِذَا is followed by an imperfect, and sometimes
<lb/>preceded by كَانَ or the like.
<lb/>REM. c. So also with two perfect verbs after حَتى إِذَا (see
<lb/>§ 415 c) as حَتَّى إِذَا أَقَلَتْ سَحَابًا سُقنَاهُ until, when they (the
<lb/>winds) bear cloud, We drive it; or in English idiom, till they bear
<lb/>cloud, when We drive it.
<lb/>406. (a) After إنْ if (see § 367 f) and words similarly of
<lb/>conditional meaning, the perfect is said to take a future sense
<lb/>and can be rendered by the English present; as, for instance, after
<lb/>مَنْ who, whoever, مَا what, مَهْمَا whatever, حَيْثُ where, and the
<lb/>like. Thus إنْ كُنَّا نَحْنُ الْغَالِبِينَ if we be the victors, مَنْ يُوقَ
<lb/>شُحَّ نَفْسِهِ whoever is made to guard against his own covetousness,
<lb/>إِلاَّ مَا شَآءَ except what he wishes, كُلُوا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمْ eat wherever ye
<lb/>wish. In certain cases this rule applies to أَوْ or.
<pb n="138">
<lb/>(b) If the words إِنْ etc. be followed by two clauses, the first
<lb/>expressing a condition and the second its result, both verbs may be perfect.
<lb/>(c) If the perfect after إِنْ etc. is to keep its original sense,
<lb/>كَانَ or one of أَخَوَاتُ كَانَ the sisters of the verb kâna (see § 442)
<lb/>must stand in the protasis before the verb and فَ must mark
<lb/>the apodosis. Thus إِنْ كُنُنْتَ جِئْتَ بِآيَةٍ فَأْتِ بِهَا إِنْ كُنْتَ مِنَ
<lb/>الصَّادِقِين if thou hast brought a sign, produce it, if thou art of the truthful.
<lb/>(d and e) Other cases arise in the use of إِنْ and similar words.
<lb/>REM. c. When مَا etc. are interrogatives or simple relatives,
<lb/>and جَيْثُ a simple relative adverb, without any conditional signification,
<lb/>perfects dependent upon them keep their original sense.
<lb/>407. After مَا as long as (see § 367 p) the perfect has a present
<lb/>or future signification; thus اتقوا الله ما اسْتَطَعْتُمْ fear God as
<lb/>far as ye are able.
<lb/>408. The Imperfect Indicative expresses no temporal definition,
<lb/>but indicates a state existing at any time. Hence it signifies; —
<lb/>(a) what is always taking, or may at any time take, place
<lb/>(the indefinite present); as يَخْرُجُ نَبَاتُهُ its (the land's)
<lb/>plants come forth by permission of its Lord:
<lb/>(b) and incomplete act, commenced and continuing (the definite present);
<lb/>as أَنْصَحُ لَكُمْ I counsel you:
<pb n="139">
<lb/>(c) what will occur (the simple future), as كّذلِكَ نُخْرِجُ
<lb/>الْمَوْتَى thus shall We bring forth the dead; اُذُْكُرْ يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُكُمْ
<lb/>make mention of the day whereon He shall assemble you. The
<lb/>future sense may be made more distinct by using سَوْفَ (see § 364 e),
<lb/>thus فَسَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ so ye shall know; or سَ (see § 361 b),
<lb/>سَنَزِيدُ الْمُحْسِنِينَ We will give increase to the righteous.
<lb/>(d) When appended to the perfect without intervening particle,
<lb/>it expresses (either what is explained in the following subsection, or)
<lb/>an act which was future to the past time of which
<lb/>we speak; thus أَرْسَلَ يُعْلِمُهُ he sent to inform him of this,
<lb/>أَجْمَعَ يُمْكِرُ بِالْيَهُودِ he determined to circumvent the Jews.
<lb/>(e) Under circumstances similar to those mentioned in the
<lb/>preceding subsection, the imperfect indicative frequently expresses
<lb/>an act which continues during the past time, and then
<lb/>it can be translated by the English present participle; thus
<lb/>أَخَذَ بِرَأْسِ أَخِيهِ يَجُرُّهُ إِلَيْهِ he grasped head of his brother,
<lb/>dragging it towards himself; وَرِثُوا الْكِتَابَ يَأْخُذُونَ عَرَضَ هذَا
<lb/>الأَدْنَى ويَقُولُونَ سَيُغْفَرُ لَنَا they inherited the book, taking the vain
<lb/>goods of this nearer (i. e. the present world) and saying, We shall
<lb/>be pardoned.
<lb/>REM. a. After لاَ not the imperfect indicative retains its idea
<lb/>of incompleteness and duration, as الذِي خَبُثَ لَا يَخْرُجُ إِلاَّ نَكِدًا
<lb/>as to that (land) which is bad (its plants) do not come forth except
<lb/>scantily. After مَا not it has the present sense (see § 557),as
<lb/>مَا تَنْقِمُ مِنَّا thou dost not take vengeance on us.
<pb n="140">
<lb/>409. By prefixing كَانَ to the imperfect indicative we point
<lb/>out a past act which continued or was repeated; thus بَطَلَ مَا
<lb/>كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ worthless was they were doing, الَّذِينَ كَانُوا
<lb/>يُسْتَضْعَفُونَ who used to be esteemed weak.
<lb/>411. The Subjunctive mood has always a future sense after
<lb/>the adverb لَنْ not (see § 362 hh), as لَنْ تَرَانِي thou shalt not see
<lb/>Me; also after certain conjunctions. amongst which are أَنْ that,
<lb/>as يُرِيدُ أَنْ يُخْرِجَكُمْ he wishes that not, as أَنْ لاَ
<lb/>(pronounced أَلاَّsee §14 b, rem. b) that not, as حَقِيق عَلَيَّ أَنْ لاَ
<lb/>أَقُولَ عَلَى اللهِ إِلاَّ الْحَقَّ(it is) binding on me that I shall not
<lb/>speak concerning God except the truth; and لِ that, so that, as
<lb/>أَتَذَرُ مُوسَى لِيُفْسِدَ فِي الأَرْضِ وَيَذَرَكَ وَآلِهَتَكَ dost thou leave
<lb/>Moses so that he shall commit disorders in the land and shall
<lb/>leave thee and thy gods? For further particulars see § 415
<lb/>412. The Jussive mood takes the perfect's meaning when
<lb/>preceded by لَمْ not (see § 362 ff) or لَمَّا not yet, as أَلمْ يُؤْخَذْ عَلَيْهِمْ
<lb/>مِيثَاقُ الْكِتَابِ has not the covenant of the book been made with
<lb/>them? See § 418.
<lb/>413. The jussive after إِنْ if and words of conditional sense
<lb/>(see § 406) has the same meaning as the perfect in a similar
<lb/>situation: as إِنْ تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَة يَطَّيَّرُوا if an
<lb/>evil befall them, they attribute their bad luck to Mose and those
<lb/>who are with him; مَهْمَا تَأْتنَا به منْ آيَة لتَسْحَرَنَا بهَا whatever
<lb/>sign thou bringest us in order that thou mayest bewitch us thereby.
<lb/>When the first of two correlative clauses contains an imperartive,
<pb n="141">
<lb/>and the second a jussive, the latter has the same meaning as if
<lb/>the first clause contained a verb in the jussive preceded by إنْ
<lb/>thus اُدْخُلُوا الْبَابَ نَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ خَطِيئَاتِكُمْ enter the gate (and) We
<lb/>will pardon to you your sins meaning if ye enter the gate We will
<lb/>pardon you. See § 417 c ii.
<lb/>414. The imperfect Energetics are future in sense, as لَأُقَطّعَنَّ
<lb/>أَيْدِيَكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ مِنْ خِلاَفٍ ثُمَّ لَأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ I will cut off your
<lb/>hands and feet on opposite sides, then I will crucify you. See § 419.
<lb/>415. The Subjunctive mood, which can occur only in a subordinate clause,
<lb/>indicates an act dependent upon, and future to,
<lb/>that mentioned in the previous clause: it is governed by certain
<lb/>particles, amongst which are the following.
<lb/>(a) i. By أَنْ (see § 367 e) that after verbs expressing inclination
<lb/>order, permission, necessity etc.; as also by أَنْ لاَ that not
<lb/>and لَنْ not (see § 362 hh). Thus عَسَى رَبُّكُمْ أَنْ يُهْلِكَ عَدُوَّكُمْ
<lb/>your Lord may perhaps destroy your enemies; see also examples in § 411.
<lb/>NOTE. When إِمَّا (see § 367 f) is used,the ruling verb may
<lb/>be understood, as قَالُوا يَا مُوسَى إِمَّا أَنْ نُلْقِيَ وَإِمَّا أَنْ نَكُونَ
<lb/>نَحْنُ الْمُلْقِينَ they said, O Moses (choose) either that thou or
<lb/>we throw. We find أَنْ لَنْ as زَعَمَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَنْ لَنْ يُبْعَثُوا
<lb/>the unbelievers have asserted t that they shall not be raised (from
<lb/>the dead) : here أَنْ stands for أَنَّهُمْ and this is common when
<lb/>the verb is negatived,as well as when the verb is strengthened]
<lb/>with سَ قَدْ or سَوْفَ
<pb n="142">
<lb/>ii. But if the ruling verb makes an assertion (without
<lb/>expectation, wish, or the like) and the verb following أَنْ is to
<lb/>express a past or present sense we use the perfect or imperfect
<lb/>indicative after أَنْ Thus عَجِبْتُمْ أَنْ جَآءَكُمْ ذِكْر ye wonder
<lb/>that an admonition has come to you, أَعْلَمُ أَنْ يَنَامُ I know that he
<lb/>is sleeping. It is however more usual in this case to employ a
<lb/>nominal proposition (see § 513) using أَنَّ with a pronoun: thus
<lb/>يَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ تَقُومُ he knows that thou standest, أَلَمْ يَرَوْا أنَّهُ لَا يُكَلِّمُهُمْ
<lb/>could they not perceive that it (the calf) did not speak to them?
<lb/>If the ruling verb expresses doubt or supposition concerning a
<lb/>thing future, أَنْ may govern the imperfect indicative or subjunctive;
<lb/>as ظَنُّوا أَنْ يَقَعَُ عَلَيْهِمْ they tough it was about to
<lb/>fall upon them.
<lb/>REM. a. As regards أَنِ المَصْدَرِيَّةُ the 'an which with its verb
<lb/>is equivalent to a maçdar, see § 488.
<lb/>(b) By لِ in order that (see § 366 c ii) and its compounds;
<lb/>thus إِنَّ هذَا لَمَكْر مَكَرْتُمُوهُ فِي الْمَدِينَةِ لِتَخْرِجُوا أَهْلَهَا verily
<lb/>this is a plot which ye have contrived in the city on order that ye
<lb/>may drive out of it its people.
<lb/>REM. a. Originally لِ was a preposition (see § 356 c), and
<lb/>when a conjunction it stand for لِأَنْ for that, as is seen in the
<lb/>negative لِئَلاَّ (for لِأَنْ لَا): we cannot say لِلاَ
<lb/>(c) By حَتَّى will till (also originally a preposition, see § 358 b):
<lb/>but if no intention or expectation of the agent be implied, there
<lb/>follows the indicative, or as in § 405, rem. c, the perfect.
<lb/>(d) By فَ so that when it introduces a clause giving the
<pb n="143">
<lb/>result or effect of a preceding clause which expresses a wish;
<lb/>thus عَسَى رَبُّكُمْ أَنْ يَسْتَخلِفَكُمْ فِي الأَرْضِ فَيَنْظُرَ كَيْفَ تَعْمَلْونَ
<lb/>your Lord may perhaps make you successors in the land, so that
<lb/>He may see how ye act. There are other conditions under which
<lb/>فَ governs a subjunctive.
<lb/>416. The Indicative must be used in all clauses except
<lb/>those governed by أَنْ or other particle with sense of أَنْ as
<lb/>كَذِلكَ نُصَرِّفُ الآياتِ لِقَومٍ يَشْكُرُونَ thus We diversify the signs
<lb/>to a grateful people; أَعْلَمُ مشنَ اللهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ I know from
<lb/>God what ye know not; تُضِلُّ مَنْ تَشَآءُ وَتَهْدِي مَنْ تَشَآءُ Thou
<lb/>causest to err whomsoever Thou dost wish, and Thou leadest aright
<lb/>whom Thou dost will; لَعَلَّهُمْ يَذَّكَّرُونَ perhaps they will take
<lb/>warning; إِذَا هُمْ يَنْكُثُونَ lo, they break their promise; إِذْ يَعْدُونَ
<lb/>فِي السَّبْتِ when they transgress on the Sabbath.
<lb/>417. The Jussive usually conveys an order, being connected
<lb/>in form with the imperative.
<lb/>(a) It is used with لِ prefixed (the li of command, see §366c i)
<lb/>in place of the imperative; and if فَ وَ be also employed, we
<lb/>may write لْ thus عَلَى اللهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ المُؤْمِنُونَ upon God
<lb/>then let the believers rely (as to this verb's final vowel, see §20d).
<lb/>We seldom find ل thus used except with the 3rd person, which
<lb/>is wanting to the imperative.
<lb/>(b) With the adverb لاَ (see §362dd) we use it to express a
<lb/>prohibition, or a wish that something be not done; as لاَ تُفْسِدْ do
<lb/>not thou (masc.) commit disorders; لاَ تُشْمِتْ بِيَ الأَعْدَآءَ وَلاَ
<pb n="144">
<lb/>تَجْعَلْنِي مَعَ الْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ do not thou make mine enemies to
<lb/>rejoice at my trouble, and do not place me with the wrongdoers.
<lb/>(c) i. Also we find jussives in the protasis and apodosis of
<lb/>correlative conditional clauses, which depend upon إِنْ or any
<lb/>particle having the sense of إِنْ (see §§406 and 413): in the
<lb/>protasis, when the verb is without كان and is imperfect; in the
<lb/>apodosis, when without فَ and having as imperfect verb. Thus
<lb/>إِنْ يَرَوا سَبِيلَ الْغَيِّ يَتَّخِذُوهُ سَبِيلاً if they see the path of error,
<lb/>they will adopt it for their path; إِنْ تَأْتِهِ عَرَض مِثْلُهُ يَأْخُذُهُ if
<lb/>worthless gain come to him like it (the former) he accepts it (also);
<lb/>مَن يُؤمِنْ باللهِ يَهْدِ قَلْبَهُ whosoever believes in God, He shall
<lb/>direct his heart. If however فَmarks the apodosis, we must use
<lb/>an indicative; as مَنْ يُؤمَنِْ بِرَبِّهِ فَلاَ يَخَافُ whosoever believes
<lb/>in his Lord, does not fear.
<lb/>ii. The jussive may appear n apodosis when the protasis
<lb/>contains an imperative verb; as فَخُذِ الأَلْوَاحَ بِقُوَّةٍ وَأْمُرْ قَوْمَكَ
<lb/>يَأْخُذُوا بِأَحْسَنِِهَا and thereupon (We said) Take the tables with
<lb/>force, and command thy people (so) shall they grasp the best part
<lb/>thereof; أَرْسِلْ حَاشِرِينَ يَأْتُوكَ بِكُلِّ سَاحِرٍ عَلِيمٍ send gatherers
<lb/>(and) they shall bring thee every skilled magician; أَرِنِي أَنْظُرْ إِلَيْكَ
<lb/>show me (Thyself, and) I shall look upon thee. This construction
<lb/>is explained in §413.
<lb/>Rem. b. The conditional sentence whose apodosis must be
<lb/>introduced by ف is further treated in §587.
<lb/>Rem. c. When (1) the apodosis has a jussive, connected with
<lb/>a following imperfect by وَ فَ we usually employ the jussive
<pb n="145">
<lb/>again; thus إِنْ تُقْرَضُوا اللهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا يُضَاعَفْهُ لَكُمْ ويَغفر لَكُم
<lb/>if ye lend to God a fair loan, he will multiply it to you and
<lb/>will pardon you: so when (2) the protasis has a jussive, connected
<lb/>with the following imperfect by وَ فَ as إِنْ تَعْفُوا وَتَصْفَحُوا
<lb/>وَتَغْفِرُوا فَإِنَّ اللهَ غَفُر رَحِيم if ye condone and pardon and forgive,
<lb/>surely God is forgiving and merciful. Here also مَنْ يُؤْمِنْ بِاللهِ
<lb/>ويَعْمَلْ صَالِحًا يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّئاته ويدخِلهُ جَنّات whose believes in
<lb/>God and does right, He shall efface from him his misdeeds and
<lb/>shall cause him to enter gardens (of Paradise).
<lb/>418. The jussive is also used with the perfect's meaning, as
<lb/>we have seen in §412, after لَمْnot or لَمَّا not yet; but in these
<lb/>cases we have the jussive's form and not its sense. Thus
<lb/>أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَبَأْ has there not reached you a story?
<lb/>Note. When انْ if precedes, we observe §406 a; thus
<lb/>إِنْ لَمْ يَرْحَمْنَا رَبُّنَا if our Lord do not show us mercy.
<lb/>419. The imperfect Energetic (see §414) has several uses,
<lb/>amongst which are the following:—
<lb/>(a) With ل verily (see §361 c) prefixed to it in a simple asseveration,
<lb/>thus تَأَذَّنَ رَبُّكَ لَيَبْعثَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ مَنْ يَسُومُهُمْ سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ
<lb/>thy Lord proclaimed (that) he would surely send against them one
<lb/>who should afflict them with woeful torment; and in asseverations
<lb/>strengthened by an oath, thus قُلْ بَلَى وَرَبِّي لَتُبْعَثُنَّ ثُمَّ لَتُنَبَّؤُنَّ
<lb/>بِمَا عَمِلْتُمْ say, On the contrary, by my Lord, ye shall be raised
<lb/>(from the dead), then ye shall be informed of what ye have done.
<lb/>(c) With لَ in the apodosis of correlative conditional clauses
<pb n="146">
<lb/>in which case لَ must be prefixed to the protasis also, as
<lb/>لَئِنْ لَمْ يَغْفِرْ لَنَا رَبَّنَا لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ verily if our Lord
<lb/>do not pardon us, we shall surely be of those who suffer loss.
<lb/>420. The Imperative cannot be used in negative sense:
<lb/>instead we msut employ the jussive as in §417b. Thus هُدْ
<lb/>repent thou, لاَ تَهُدْ do not (thou) repent; كَلِّمْنَا بِالْعَرَبِيَّةِ وَلاَ تُكَلِمْنَا
<lb/>بِالْإِنْكِلِيزِيَّةِ speak Arabic to us, do not speak in English.
<lb/>421`. The verb may govern a noun in its accusative (or
<lb/>oblique) case, and by help of a preposition a noun which we then
<lb/>put in the dependent (or oblique) case. We shall have frequent
<lb/>examples of this government, not only by States and Moods,
<lb/>but also by nomina actionis, agentis, et patientis and by other
<lb/>nouns possessing verbal force. Sometimes the verb is understood;
<lb/>or it may lie concealed in a particle.
<lb/>422. The accusative of a noun is governed by the verb, either
<lb/>(a) as an objective complement, assigning a limit; or
<lb/>(b) as an adverbial complement, see §440 et seq.
<lb/>423. Most transitive verbs take their objective complement
<lb/>in the accusative, as لاَ تَتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ الْمُفْسِدِينَ do not thou follow
<lb/>the path of the transgressor; many however govern the object
<lb/>by help of a preposition, as لَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ when the plague
<lb/>fell upon them; some govern in both ways with the same
<lb/>meaning, thus كَذَّبُوهُ they accused him of lying, and أَغْرَقْنَا الَّذِينَ
<lb/>كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا We drowned those who charged with falsehood Our
<lb/>signs. More frequently a verb which governs in both ways has
<pb n="147">
<lb/>different meanings, thus مَسَّكَهُ he perfumed it with musk, مَسَّكَ بِهِ
<lb/>he held it fast; and diverse significations may attach to the same
<lb/>verb if used with different prepositions, thus رَغِبَ to desire,
<lb/>which is transitive and intransitive, has رَغِبَ فِي to like, رَغِبَ عَنْ
<lb/>to dislike, and رَغِبَ إِلَى to supplicate.
<lb/>Rem. a. Amongst الأَفْعَالُ الْمُتَعَدِّيَةُ the transitive verbs (see
<lb/>§75) we include those which govern by help of a preposition
<lb/>alike with those whose object is in the accusative. Besides being
<lb/>transitive as وَقَعَ عَلَي to fall upon, the same verb may be intransitive
<lb/>as وَقَعَ to befall, come to pass, thus فَوَقَعَ الْحَقُّ so the
<lb/>truth was established.
<lb/>Rem. b. Dictionaries will teach a student how each verb
<lb/>may be employed. Be it observed that, in Arabic, verbs to com
<lb/>govern the accusative and require no intervening preposition,
<lb/>thus أَتَيْتُهُ I come to him, أَتَيْتُهَا I come to her with it, i. e.
<lb/>I brought it to her, جَآءَ السَّحَرَةُ فِرْعَوْنَ the magicians came to
<lb/>Pharaoh, جَآؤُوا بِسِحْرٍ عَظِيمٍ they brought a mighty enchantment
<lb/>(see §456b).
<lb/>Rem. c. A sentence may stand as objective complement,
<lb/>thus دَمَّرْنَا مَا كَانَ يَصْنَعُ We destroyed what he was making
<lb/>(see §514). As regards قَالَ to say and its derivatives we may
<lb/>note, that when followed by حِكَايَة a narration one uses قَالَ إِنَّ
<lb/>thus قُلْ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللهِ إِلَيْكُمْ say thou, Verily I am God's apostle
<lb/>to you, and what follows it is commonly a quotation, as قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ
<lb/>قَوْم تَجْهَلُونَ he said, Certainly ye are an ignorant people. Very
<lb/>sparingly, if at all, is it permitted to use قَالَ أَنَّ
<pb n="148">
<lb/>424. Two objective complements in the accusative may
<lb/>follow certain verbs, of which there are two sorts.
<lb/>(a) Those whose objects are unconnected, they being causatives
<lb/>of which the ground form is transitive and governs an
<lb/>accusative (see §41 and §45); thus أُبَلِّغُكُمْ رِسَالاَتِ I bring you
<lb/>messages, يُغْشِي اللَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ He causes the might to cover the day,
<lb/>خُذُوا مَا آتَيْنَاكُمْ take what We have given you, سَأُرِيكُمْ دَارَ الْفَاسِقِينَ
<lb/>I will show you the dwelling of the impious, يُورِثُهَا مَنْ يَشاءُ مِنْ
<lb/>عِبَادِهِ He causes whom He will of His servants to inherit it: also
<lb/>some other verbs of causative nature, meaning to give, lend,
<lb/>etc. as كُلُوا مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ eat what We have provided for you,
<lb/>اِهْدِنَا الصِرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ direct us (in) the straight road, لاَ يَهْدِيهِمْ
<lb/>سَبِيلاً it (the calf) did not direct them (in) a (right) path, يَسُومُونَكُمْ
<lb/>سُوءَ الْعَذَابِ they lay upon you the evil of punishment, واعدْنَا مُوسَى
<lb/>ثَلاثِينَ لَيْلَةً We appointed with Moses (a period of) thirty nights.
<lb/>(b) Those whose objects stand to one another in the relation
<lb/>of subject and predicate; being (i) verbs signifying to make,
<lb/>adopt, name, appoint, etc., as جَعَلَهُ دَكًّا he made it (into) atoms,
<lb/>قَطَّعْنَاهُمْ أُمَمًا We divided them into nations; or (ii) أَفْعَالُ الْقَلْبِ
<lb/>the verbs of the heart, which are so called because their action is
<lb/>mental; for instance رَأى to see, think, know and its IV passive
<lb/>أُرِيَ to think, believe, عَلِمَ to know, زَعَمَ to deem, قَالَ to think, etc.;
<lb/>thus ظَنَنْتُهَا صَبُورًا I thought her patient, يَجدُونَهُ مَكْتُوبًا they find
<lb/>him mentioned (lit. written).
<lb/>Rem. b. Verbs like رَأَى and وَجَدَ must also be reckoned
<lb/>among أَفْعَالُ الْحَسِّ verbs of (the organs of) sense.
<pb n="149">
<lb/>Rem. d. Three accusative are governed by أَفْعَالُ الْقَلْبِ in
<lb/>their fourth form, as سَيُرِيكُمْ أَعْمَالَكُمْ he will make you
<lb/>think your actions foul.
<lb/>426. All verbs, transitive and intransitive, active and passive,
<lb/>may take their own مَصَادِرُ infinitives (see §195), or their deverbal
<lb/>nouns of the classes nomina vicis et speciei*, as objective complements
<lb/>in the accusative. Thus ضَرَبَهُ ضَرْبًا he gave him a
<lb/>beating, طَمِعَ طَمَعًا he desired eagerly, ضُرِبَ ضَرْبًا he received a
<lb/>beating, اِسْتَكْبَرُوا اِسْتِكْبَارًا they were puffed with arrogant pride.
<lb/>This accusative is called اَلْمَفْعُولُ الْمُطْلَقُ the absolute object or
<lb/>اَلْمَصْدَرُ and it may appear, or be مَحْذُوف eliminated: thus
<lb/>يَعْمَلُ صَالِحًا he does right for يَعْمَلُ عَمَلاً صَالِحًا also يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا
<lb/>for يَطْلُبُهُ طَلَبًا حَثِيثًا he follows it in swift search. We have given
<lb/>(§202Note) عَذَاب as derivative of the second form to which it
<lb/>serves as maçdar, thus أُعّذِّبُهُمْ عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا I will chastise them
<lb/>very severely; but the maçdar of a different form may be employed,
<lb/>or even of a different verb provided it be synonymous.
<lb/>Note. Verbal nouns (nomina actionis agentis et patientis, etc.)
<lb/>can like finite verbs الْمَفْعُولُ الْمُطْلَقُ thus اللهُ مُعَذِّبُهُمْ
<lb/>عَذَابًا شَدِيدًا God is their very severe chastiser.
<lb/>427. It has been observed of nomina verbi (in § 195 and 421)
<lb/>that, when infinitives from verbs which govern an objective
<lb/>complement in the accusative case, they can govern an accusative
<lb/>instead of a dependent. This is especially the case if one or more
<lb/>*Nomina vicis et speciei are treated in Wright's Grammar, vol. I. §§219, 220.
<pb n="150">
<lb/>words divide an object from its governing infinitive, because a
<lb/>dependent case cannot be separated from the word which governs
<lb/>it. Also, when an infinitive is defined by the article, its object
<lb/>must stand in the accusative, because the noun do defined cannot
<lb/>take after it a dependent.
<lb/>Rem. c. Beside infinitives (nomina actionis) there are verbal
<lb/>nouns of similar force and significance which govern in the same way.
<lb/>428. With rare exceptions, infinitives govern by help of a
<lb/>preposition, when from verbs which are transitive in that manner.
<lb/>429. Frequently however an infinitive governs its objective
<lb/>complement in the dependent with لِ (see §453) instead of in
<lb/>the accusative. Thus كَتَبْنَا تَفْصِيلاً لِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ We wrote an exposition
<lb/>of everything. So it is with certain other verbal nouns.
<lb/>430. Nomina agentis can, like infinitives, govern a noun in
<lb/>the accusative, as اَللهُ مُعَذِّب الْقَوْمَ God is a chastiser of the
<lb/>people, or in the dependent, as اللهُ مُهْلِكُ الْقَوْمِ God is the
<lb/>destroyer of the people.
<lb/>Note. When derived from verbs which are transitive by help
<lb/>of a preposition, nomina agentis must govern in the same way.
<lb/>Thus إِنَّا الَى رَبنا مُنقَلِبُونَ verily to our Lord shall we return;
<lb/>كَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا وَكَانُوا عَنْهَا غَافِلِينَ they denied Our signs, and were.
<lb/>negl&dotectors of them; ظَنُّوا أَنَّهُ وَاقِع عَلَيْهِمْ they thought it to be
<lb/>falling upon them; أُلائكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّار خَالدين فيهَا these are the
<lb/>people of Hell-fire, abiding therein.
<pb n="151">
<lb/>431. What has been said in § 429 concerning لِ after an
<lb/>infinitive, applies equally to a nomen agentis.
<lb/>Rem. When by rhetorical transposition a finite verb, which is
<lb/>transitive without help from a preposition, follows its object, we
<lb/>may use the accusative, as مَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلَكِنْ كَانُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ
<lb/>they did not injure Us, but they were injuring themselves; or we
<lb/>may employ لِ as اَلَّذِينَ لِرَبِّهِمْ يَرْهَبُونَ those who fear their Lord.
<lb/>In like case a nomen agentis cannot govern an accusative but
<lb/>requires أَنْتُمْ لَهَا كَارِهُونَ thus إِيَّا ye dislike her. If the transposed
<lb/>object be a pronominal suffix, إِيَّا may with the finite verb
<lb/>be employed instead of لِ as in §189b.
<lb/>433. Beside the nomina agentis, some other verbal adjectives
<lb/>govern either an accusative case or لِ with the dependent.
<lb/>Note. When derived from verbs which are transitive by help
<lb/>of a preposition, these adjectives govern in the same way. Thus
<lb/>حَقِيق عَلَيَّ binding upon me, هُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيءٍ قَدِير He is able
<lb/>for everything, اللهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيم God is acquainted with everything.
<lb/>435. Frequently the accusative depends upon a verb which
<lb/>is مَحْذُوف eliminated:—
<lb/>(a) In phrases of command, exclamations, etc. we must
<lb/>supply the verb to which the accusative noun serves as المفعول
<lb/>المطلق (see §426). Thus مهلاً gently! for أَمْهِلْ مَهْلاً deal gently,
<lb/>سَمْعًا وَطَاعةً hearing and obeying for أَسْمَعُ سَمْعًا وَأُطِيعُ طَاعَةً I
<lb/>hear well and implicitly obey.
<pb n="152">
<lb/>NOTE. The Arabian grammarians represent that سُبْحَانَكَ
<lb/>stands for أُسَبِّحُ سُبْحَانَكَ I praise Thine absolute perfection (see § 41, rem. c.).
<lb/>(b) In other cases the verb must be conjectured, as أَهْلاً وَسَهْلاً
<lb/>where we may supply أَتَيْتَ thou hast come to people and a plain,
<lb/>i.e. to friends and a smooth place; مَرْحَبًا بِكَ that is وَجَدتًّ
<lb/>thou hast found for thyself roominess (see § 27 Note); رِجْلَكَ
<lb/>that is قِ (see § 178) guard thy foot; وَرَآءَكَ that is اُنْظُرْ look behind thee.
<lb/>436. The adverb إِنَّ and the conjunction أَنَّ take the following
<lb/>noun or pronoun in the accusative case instead of in the
<lb/>nominative (as one expects the subject of a sentence to be)
<lb/>because, so it is said, these particles embody the verb to see;
<lb/>thus إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ اللهُ verily (i. e. see) your Lord (He) is God,
<lb/>أَوَلاَ يَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّ اللهَ يَعْلَمْ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ do they not
<lb/>know that God knows what they conceal and what they reveal?
<lb/>So in case of their compounds لَكِنَّ and وَلكِنَّ (see § 362 ee and
<lb/>§ 584 b) but, yet, كَأَنَّ as though (see § 367 g), and when coupled
<lb/>with a preposition, as بِأَنَّ and لِأَنَّ thus وَلكِنَّ أَكْثرَهُم لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ
<lb/>but most of them do not know, كأَنَّهُ ظُلَّة as though it were a
<lb/>canopy, أَلَمْ يَعْلَمْ بِأَنَّ اللهَ يَرَى does he not know that God sees?
<lb/>In the above examples the subject immediately follows إِنَّ etc.
<lb/>and under such circumstances لَ (see § 361 c) may be prefixed to
<lb/>the predicate; thus إِنَّا لَنَرَاكَ فِي ضَلاَلٍ verily we perceive thee
<lb/>(to be) in error; إِنَّ ربك لسريع العقابِ وَإِنَّهُ لَغَفُور رَحِيم surely
<pb n="153">
<lb/>thy Lord is prompt with chastisement and certainly He is forgiving
<lb/>and merciful. They may however be a separation,
<lb/>between إَنَّ etc. and the subject, caused by an adverb of time
<lb/>and place or by a preposition with its complement; thus
<lb/>إَنَّ مِنْ أَزْوَاجِكُمْ وَأَوْلاَدِكُمْ عَدُوَّا لَكُمْ verily enemies of you are (to be found)
<lb/>amongst your spouses and children: when this separation
<lb/>occurs لَ may be prefixed to the subject of إِنَّ or as
<lb/>أَئِنَّ لَنَا لَأَجْرًا shall there indeed be to us a reward! If the
<lb/>predicate be negative we must not use لَ thus إِنَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ
<lb/>الْمُعْتَدِينَ surely He doth not love the transgressors; إِنَّا لاَ نُضِيعُ
<lb/>أَجْرَ الْمُصْلِحِينَ verily We will not allow to be lost the reward of
<lb/>the righteous: and so if the verb be a perfect without قَدْ thus
<lb/>إِنَّ الْقَوْمَ اسْتَضعفوني وكادُوا يَقْتُلُونَنِي surely the people despised
<lb/>me and were just on the point of slaying me.
<lb/>REM. a. These particles, together with those given in rem. f,
<lb/>are named إِنَّ وَأَخَوَاتُهَا inna and its sisters. The word governed
<lb/>is called their اِسْم noun (see § 525 rem.) and the predicate خَبَر
<lb/>REM. b. If the predicate is placed between إِنَّ or أَنّ
<lb/>and its noun, the logical emphasis falls upon the latter, thus
<lb/>ان معك صاحبك your friend is with you.; but if the predicate
<lb/>follows the noun, it receives the logical emphasis itself, as
<lb/>إَنَّ صَاحِبَكَ مَعَكَ your friend is with you.
<lb/>REM. d. In § 353 * we have mentioned مَا الْكَافَّةُ the hindering
<lb/>mâ, which when appended to كَأنَّ أَنَّ إِنَّ and لَكِنَّ is followed
<lb/>by a nominative; thus إِنَّمَا أَوْلاَدُكُمْ فِتْنَة your children are only
<pb n="154">
<lb/>a temptation, واعلموا انما اموالكم فتنة know that your riches are
<lb/>a temptation. The same influence is exercised by ضَمِيرُ الشَّأنِ
<lb/>(see § 362 m and § 367 g) as إِنَّهُ كِرَام قَوْمُكَ truly thy people are generous.
<lb/>REM. e. A lightened form of these particles may be used.
<lb/>REM. f. The words لَيْتَ would that and عَلَّ or لَعَلَّ perhaps
<lb/>govern an accusative like إِنَّ etc., thus لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكرُونَ perhaps
<lb/>ye will take warning.
<lb/>438. An interjection usually precedes the person or thing
<lb/>called; while for vocative case we must use the nominative or accusative.
<lb/>(a) As has been noted in § 368 يَا O! takes its following
<lb/>noun without the article.
<lb/>(i) We use the nominative—in the singular without tanwîn
<lb/>—when a particular person or thing is addressed by the speaker
<lb/>directly and without explanatory term; thus يَا مُحَمَّدُ O Mu&hdot;ammad!
<lb/>يَا رجُلُ O man! or Sir, قَالَ مُوسَى يَا فِرْعَوْنُ Moses
<lb/>said, O Pharaoh!
<lb/>(ii) We use the accusative when the person or thing called
<lb/>is indefinite and not directly addressed, يَا رَجُلاً somebody!; as
<lb/>also when an explanatory term is appended, thus يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ
<lb/>O sons of Israel! يَا إِخْوَتَنَا O brothers of ours!
<lb/>REM. a. These rules hold good in the absence of an interjection,
<lb/>as رَبَّنَا أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْرًا O our Lord, pour upon us patience.
<lb/>REM. b. In the vocative ي is usually shortened into—
<lb/>(see § 317, rem. b), thus يَا قَوْمِ O my people! رَبِّ O my Lord!
<pb n="155">
<lb/>but this abbreviation is not permitted with derivatives ending
<lb/>in ي or —from verbs whose final radical is و or ي Beside
<lb/>ي and —there are other forms possible, as قَالَ ابْنَ أُمَّ he
<lb/>(Aaron) said, O son of my mother!
<lb/>REM. d. One word only, viz. اللهُ may retain the article and
<lb/>follow يَا thus يَا اللهُ O God! or irregularly يَا اللهُ
<lb/>(b) The noun following أَيُّهَا or يَا أَيُّهَا whether singular, dual
<lb/>or plural, must be nominative and defined by the article; thus
<lb/>أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ O people! يَا أَيُّهَا الذِينَ O ye who believe!
<lb/>439. When لاَ is immediately followed by an indefinite object
<lb/>and denies its existence we make the noun accusative and, if
<lb/>possible, we omit tanwîn; as اللهُ لاَ إِلهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ God, there is no
<lb/>god but He. Should an explanatory term follow, tanwîn is retained;
<lb/>as لاَ حَافِظَا للقُرْآنِ عِنْدَكُمْ there is no one knowing the
<lb/>Corân by heart amongst you.
<lb/>440. we have been treating objective complements since
<lb/>§ 422 and shall now consider the adverbial complement. This
<lb/>sort of accusative depends (a) when expressed by كَانَ to be,
<lb/>exist (and by certain similar verbs, see § 442) on the idea of
<lb/>existence or being, which is limited and determined by the
<lb/>accusative; and (b) on circumstances detailed in § 443 et seq.
<lb/>441. When employed as the *logical copula كَانَ is called
<lb/>كَانَ النَّاقِصَةُ the incomplete kâna because to complete the sense
<lb/>* In logic the copula is a word which unites the subject and predicate of
<lb/>a proposition; in is known as الرَّابِطَةُ the fastening.
<pb n="156">
<lb/>there is required an attribute, which we must put in the accusative.
<lb/>Thus كَانُوا قَوْمًا مْجْرِمِينَ they were guilty people, اِتَّخّذُوهُ
<lb/>وَكَانُوا ظَالِمِينَ they took it (the calf for their god) and were wrong
<lb/>doers, قُلْنَا لَهُهمْ كُونُوا قِرَدَةً خَاسِئِينَ We said to them, Be ye i.e.
<lb/>Become abject apes. Also we may note كُنْ مِن الشاكِرينَ be
<lb/>thou (one) of the grateful, which is equivalent (see § 448 f) to
<lb/>كُنْ شَاكِرًا But when the idea of existence is attributed by
<lb/>كَانَ to its subject we can only employ the nominative, as
<lb/>كَانَ قِرْد there was an ape: here the verb is كَانَ التَّامَّةُ the
<lb/>complete kâna, because it contains the attributed and requires no
<lb/>other, for كانَ قِرْدًا would mean he was an ape.
<lb/>REM. a. The subject is called اِسْمُ كَانَ and the predicate
<lb/>خَبَرُ كَانَ while the natural sequence (see § 518) is verb, subject,
<lb/>predicate; this order may however be varied if sense allow.
<lb/>REM. b. Sometimes كَانَ is مَحْذُوف eliminated, as اِسْمَعُوا
<lb/>وَأَطِيعُوا وَأَنْفِقُوا خَيرًا لِأَنْفُسِكُمْ hear ye, and obey, and give alms,
<lb/>it will be better for your souls, where يَكُنْ is understood.
<lb/>442. The same construction appertains to أَخَوَاتُ كَانَ the
<lb/>sisters of kâna which are often used as synonyms of كَانَ without
<lb/>relation to time, though they add some modification to the
<lb/>simple idea of existence. In this class are دَامَ to continue,
<lb/>بَقِيَ to remain, صَارَ to become, ظَلَّ to be or do all day
<lb/>and not a few others, most of which may be تَامَّة while لَيْسَ not
<lb/>to be, which is always نَاقِصَة expresses the negation of existence;
<lb/>thus لَيْسَ بِي ضَلاَلَة in me is no error.
<pb n="157">
<lb/>REM. g. Instead of an accusative or a preposition with its
<lb/>dependent أَخَوَاتُ كَانَ may take as attribute a verb in the
<lb/>imperfect, thus following the analogy of كَانَ (see § 408 d and e,
<lb/>and § 409). With this construction we can connect that of
<lb/>أَفْعَالُ الْمُقَارَبَةِ verbs of appropinquation, which are of two kinds.
<lb/>(1) Amongst those which indicate simple proximity of the
<lb/>predicate is كَادَ (see § 157) to be just on the point of: commonly
<lb/>its predicate is an imperfect indicative, thus كَادُوا يَقْتُلُونَنِي
<lb/>they were on the point of killing me. (2) Amongst those which
<lb/>indicate a hope of the predicate's occurrence is عَسَى perhaps:
<lb/>commonly it is construed with أَنْ and the subjunctive, as
<lb/>عَسَى رَبُّكُمْ أَنْ يُهْلِكَ عَدْوَّكُمُ your Lord may perhaps destroy your
<lb/>enemy; but it can take as accusative a pronominal suffix like
<lb/>لَعَلَّ (see § 436, rem. f).
<lb/>443. Brief allusion has been made in § 440 b to other adverbial
<lb/>accusatives which determine and limit the subject, verb,
<lb/>or predicate of a sentence, and sometimes the sentence as a
<lb/>whole. These adverbial accusatives are of different sorts and indicate:—
<lb/>444. (a) The time in or during which an act occurs; as
<lb/>خالدون فيها ابدًا abiding in them (the gardens) perpetually,
<lb/>إِذْ تَأْتِيهِمْ حِيتَانُهُمْ يَوْمَ سَبْتِهمْ when their fish came to them on the
<lb/>day of their sabbath.
<lb/>(b) Locality, direction, and extension, may in certain cases
<lb/>take the accusative; as نَظَرَ يَمِينًا وَيَسَارًا he looked right and left.
<lb/>Of this sort are the words given as preposition in § 359.
<pb n="158">
<lb/>REM. a. We must use فِي in when the place is definitely
<lb/>specified, as أَقَمْتُ فِي مَقْتَل الْحُسَيْنِ I stopped at the place
<lb/>where al &Hdot;uain was killed. But with a verb meaning to remain
<lb/>or the like مَكان and similar vague nouns of place, are employed
<lb/>without preposition and therefore in the accusative; thus
<lb/>إِنِ اسْتَقَرَّ مَكَانَهُ if it stand firm in its place.
<lb/>NOTE. Certain substantives signifying time or place can be
<lb/>مُضَاف annexed (see § 475 and § 478) to a verbal sentence, but
<lb/>only in the accusative case; thus يَوْمَ لاَ يَسْبِتُونَ لاَ تَأْتِيهِم حِيتَان
<lb/>on the day on which they did not keep sabbath, fish did not come to them.
<lb/>REM. b. The accusative of time and place, illustrated in
<lb/>above examples of this section, is called الظرف the vessel (see
<lb/>§ 221, rem. a) or الْمَفْعُولُ فِيهِ that in which the act is done.
<lb/>(c) The most important however of adverbial accusatives is
<lb/>called اَلْحَالُ the state or condition, i. e. of the subject or object
<lb/>or of both, while the act is happening. Thus لَمَّا رَجَعَ مُوسَى
<lb/>إِلَى قَوْمِهِ غَضْبَانَ أَسِفًا when Moses returned to his people angry,
<lb/>afflicted i.e. in a state of affliction and anger; هُوَ الَّذِي يُرْسِلُ
<lb/>الرَّيَاحَ بُشْرًا بَيْنَ يَدَيْ رَحْمَته He it is who sends the winds, heralds
<lb/>of His mercy lit. between the two hands of His mercy i.e. in
<lb/>advance of rain; أُلْقِيَ السَّحَرَةُ سَاجِدِينَ the magicians were
<lb/>thrown down prostrate (adoring).
<lb/>REM. a. The &hdot;âl is فَضْلَة a redundancy; thus اُدْعُوا رَبَّكُمْ
<lb/>تَضَرُّعًا وَخُفْيَة call upon your Lord humbly and in secret. Here
<lb/>the command to pray is of itself a sentence; and the conditions,
<pb n="159">
<lb/>grammatically superfluous, reply to كَيْفَ how? as the accusative
<lb/>called اَلْحَالُ must always do.
<lb/>REM. b. The &hdot;âl depends upon a regent (عَامِلُ الْحَالِ) which
<lb/>may be (1) a verb, as خَرَّ مُوسَى صَعِقًا Moses fell down thunderstruck;
<lb/>or (2) a deverbal adjective; as اني رسول الله اليكم جَميعًا
<lb/>verily I am God's apostle to you all, where رَسُول is accounted
<lb/>a deverbal adjective, إِنِيّ رَسُول being equivalent to أُرْسِلْتُ I
<lb/>have been sent; or (3) a demonstrative pronoun or other expression
<lb/>having verbal force, as أَلاَآئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا
<lb/>these are the people of the fire, dwelling continually therein, where
<lb/>أُلاَئِكَ is equivalent to صِفَة they are pointed out as.
<lb/>REM. c. The &hdot;âl is (1) usually تَأْتِيهِمْ حِيتَانُهُمْ an adjective expressing
<lb/>a transitory state, as تَأْتِيهِم حِيتَانُهُمْtheir fish came to them
<lb/>manifestly: thought the adjective may express a permanent state,
<lb/>thus ربنا توفَّنَا مُسْلِمِينَ O our Lord, receive us dying as those who
<lb/>are resigned to Thy will; خَلَقَ الشمْسَ والقْمَرَ والنُجُومَ مُسْخَّرَاتٍ
<lb/>بَأَمْرِهِ He created the sun and the moon and the stars, held in
<lb/>(a state of) subjection by His command. Sometimes however
<lb/>(2) it is an infinitive with the meaning of a participial adjective;
<lb/>as أَخّذْتُ ذلَكَ مِنْهُ سَمْعًا I received that from him by hearing;
<lb/>or even (3) a concrete substantive; as فَأَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهمُ الطُّوفَانَ
<lb/>والجراد والقمل والضفادع والدم آياتٍ مُفَصَّلاَتٍ so We sent upon
<lb/>them the deluge and locusts and lice and frogs and blood (in the
<lb/>nature of) signs; separated by intervals. Lastly (4) &hdot;âl may be
<lb/>a proposition, as in § 583. There may be more than one &hdot;âl, with
<lb/>or without and between them, as can be seen above.
<pb n="160">
<lb/>REM.e. In all our examples &hdot;âl is نَكِرَة indefinite; and this is
<lb/>most usual.
<lb/>REM.f. We call the subject or object to which a &hdot;âl refers
<lb/>صَاحِبُ الْحَالِ or ذُو الْحَالِ and it is usually مَعْرِفَة definite as
<lb/>happens in all our examples.
<lb/>NOTE. Occasionally صَاحِبُ الْحَالِ is eliminated, as اَلَّذِي
<lb/>خَبُثَ لاَ يَخْرُجُ إِلاَّ نَكِدًا as to that (land) which was bad its
<lb/>herbage does not come forth except scantily, where نَبَاتُهُ must be
<lb/>supplied as çâhib to نَكِدًا
<lb/>REM. g. Also it will be observed that in all our examples the
<lb/>&hdot;âl is placed after its regent: as a rule it occupies this position.
<lb/>(d) The accusative may express an agent's motive and object
<lb/>in the act, its cause and reason; as اُدْعُوهُ خَوْفًا وَطَمَعًا call ye
<lb/>upon Him out of fear and eager desire. Definition by the article
<lb/>is unusual, this accusative being indefinite except when in construct
<lb/>state (see § 475).
<lb/>REM. Only مَصْدَر قَلْبِيّ a mental or intellectual infinitive can
<lb/>be employed in this way; thus, in Koran, VII. 164 مَعْذِرَةً (we
<lb/>warn them) by way of excusing (ourselves). Reply is given to
<lb/>the question لِمَ why? (see § 351, rem.).
<lb/>(e) Other determinations and limitations of the predicate
<lb/>may be expressed by an accusative called اَلتَّمْيِيزُ the specification;
<lb/>thus طَابَ دَآءُودُ نَفْسًا David is cheerful in spirit.
<lb/>REM.a. Like الْحَالُ this accusative is فَضْلَة see (c) rem. a.
<lb/>It must be an indefinite substantive.
<pb n="161">
<lb/>A GRAMMAR.
<lb/>REM. b. We have mentioned in §§ 322 and 323 the accusative
<lb/>which follows cardinal numbers from 11 to 99 inclusive: it is of
<lb/>this sort, being called تَمْيِزُ الْعَدَدِ the specification of number,
<lb/>and is most usually singular, see § 499.
<lb/>446. Relations of time and place are designated by prepositions,
<lb/>as also are many ideal conceptions. We shall treat those
<lb/>mentioned in § 447 as indicating motion from, in § 450 motion
<lb/>towards, and in § 454 rest at a place; while in § 470 compound
<lb/>prepositions will be found, over and above those detailed by § 355 et seq.
<lb/>447. The prepositions indicating motion from or away from
<lb/>a place, are مِنْ out of, from, and عَنْ away from.
<lb/>448. We designate by help of مِنْ
<lb/>(a) the local point of departure from a place; as أَخْرَجَكُمْ مِنْ
<lb/>أَرْضِكُم he expelled you from your land, فارسلنا عليهم رجزًا مِنَ
<lb/>السَّمَاء so We sent upon them a plague from heaven, مِنْ خِلاَفٍ
<lb/>from a contrary i. e. on opposite sides. Hence it is used with
<lb/>verbs which indicate liberating, preserving, warning, etc. as
<lb/>أنْجَيْنَاكُم مِنْ آلِ فِرْعَوْنَ We delivered you from Pharaoh's people,
<lb/>مِنْ كُلِّ شَيءٍ مَوْعِظَة a warning from i. e. against everything.
<lb/>(b) The temporal point of departure; as مِنَ الْهِجْرَةِ from
<lb/>the Hegira i. e. from 622 A.D.
<lb/>REM. a When used in any of the above significations, we
<lb/>say that مِنْ is employed للاِبْتِدَآءِ to denote the beginning.
<pb n="162">
<lb/>ELEMENTARY ARABIC:
<lb/>(c) The causal point of departure, the origin and source
<lb/>of a thing; as أَعلَمُهُ مِنَ اللهِ I know it from God, جَآءَكُمْ ذِكْر
<lb/>مِنْ رَبَّكُم an admonition has come to you from your Lord,
<lb/>مِنْ أَزْوَاجِكُمْ عَدُه from among your wires originate enemies,
<lb/>مَا تَنْقِمُ مِنَّا إِلاَّ أَنْ آمَنَّا بِآيَاتِ رَبَّنَا لَمَّا جآءَتْنَا thou dost not resent
<lb/>anything of which we are the origin except that we believed the
<lb/>signs of our Lord when they came to us.
<lb/>REM. a. Here مِنْ is employed لِلتَّعْلِيلِ to assign the reason
<lb/>(d) The distance from anything, especially after words signifying
<lb/>proximity, when in English we must render مِنْ to; thus
<lb/>إِنَّ رَحْمَة اللهِ قَرِيب مِنَ المُحْسِنِينَ surely the mercy of God is
<lb/>near to the righteous.
<lb/>(e) The difference between two things when compared:
<lb/>hence the use of مِنْ with an elative (see § 234) when comparative;
<lb/>thus أَحْسَنُ مِنْهُ handsomer than he.
<lb/>REM. a. Sometimes مِنْ with its complement is omitted; as
<lb/>الدارُ الآخِرَةُ خَيْر لِلَّذِينَ يَتَّقُونَ the last abode is better than this
<lb/>world for those who take heed to themselves, where مِنَ الدُّنْيَا may
<lb/>be supplied.
<lb/>(f) The relationship between part and whole, between species
<lb/>and genus; thus قال نَعَمْ وإِنَّكُمْ لَمِنَ المُقَرَبِينَ he said, Yes, and
<lb/>ye shall be of those who are brought near (me), اَلْملأُ مِنْ قَومِ فِرعَونَ
<lb/>the chiefs of Pharaoh's people, اُسْكُنُوا هذِهِ القريةَ وَكُلُوا مِنْها
<lb/>inhabit this village and eat therefrom, السُفَهاَءُ مِنَّا the fools among us.
<pb n="163">
<lb/>REM. a. Preceding a definite noun, which is usually plural,
<lb/>مِن may indicate an indefinite quantity or number; as كُلُوا مِنَ
<lb/>الطَّيِبَاتِ eat of the good things. Together with an indefinite
<lb/>dependent مِنْ may be subject of a sentence as in the following:
<lb/>مَا أَصَابَ مِنْ مُصِيبَةٍ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللهِ no mischance befalls except
<lb/>by permission of God.
<lb/>REM. b. Governing an indefinite noun after a negative particle,
<lb/>مِنْ gives the clause an absolute and general sense; thus
<lb/>مَا لَكُمْ مِنْ إلهٍ ye have no god whatever.
<lb/>REM. e. In these examples مِنْ is used لِلتَّبْعِيضِ to indicate
<lb/>division into parts, as also in أَخْرِجْنَا مِنْ كُلِّ الثَّمَرَاتِ We
<lb/>produced all sorts of fruit; sometimes it is employed لِلتَّرْكِيبِ to
<lb/>indicate composition.
<lb/>(g) After indefinite مَا and مَهْمَا whatever we must use مِنْ
<lb/>before the explanatory word; thus مَهْمَا تَأْتِنَا بِهِ مِنْ آيَةٍ whatever
<lb/>thou bringest us of a sign: in this case we have a general
<lb/>term rendered more definite, as also when مِنْ indicates the
<lb/>material of which an article has been made; thus عِجْل مِنْ حُلِيِّهِمْ
<lb/>a calf (made) out of their ornaments.
<lb/>REM. Here مِنْ is employed لِلْبَيَانِ to explain.
<lb/>(h) Another use of مِنْ is called التَمْيِيزُ the specification;
<lb/>thus لَقَدْ أَخَذْنَا آلَ فِرعَونَ بالسنين ونقصٍ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ We
<lb/>visited the people of Pharaoh with years (of barrenness) and with
<lb/>diminution of fruit.
<lb/>NOTE. There is yet another use of فانتقَمْنَا منْهُمْ منْ in so
<lb/>We took vengeance on them.
<pb n="164">
<lb/>449. By help of عَنْ we designate distance from, motion
<lb/>away from, and the like: hence it is used
<lb/>(a) after verbs which denote setting free, forbidding, etc. as
<lb/>يَضَعَُ عَنْهُمْ إِصرَهُمْ he puts away from them their burden, يَنْهَاهُمْ
<lb/>عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ he forbids them from the disapproved.
<lb/>(b) After verbs which imply the removal of a covering, as
<lb/>asking etc., thus وَآسْأَلْهُمْ عَنِ الْقَرْيَةِ and ask them concerning the
<lb/>village, كشفت عَنّضا الرِجزَ thou hast removed from us the plague.
<lb/>(c) After verbs which imply turning away, as كَانوا عنهُ
<lb/>غَافِلِينَ they were neglectors of it, يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سيئَاتِهِ He effaces from
<lb/>him his misdeeds, لَمَّا سَكَتَ عَنْ مُوسَى الْغَضَبُ when the anger
<lb/>became still (so as to be) away from Moses, سَأَصرِفُ عَنْ آيَاتِي
<lb/>I will cause to turn away from (the direction of) my signs,
<lb/>عَتَوا عَما عَتَا they disdainfully turned away from that from which
<lb/>he turned disdainfully, رَغِبَ عَنْهُ he avoided it.
<lb/>450. The prepositions indicating motion to or towards a
<lb/>place are إِلَى to حَتَّى up to, and لِ to.
<lb/>451. Opposed to مِن and عَنْ isإِلَى which signifies
<lb/>(a) motion or direction to or towards a place; thus أرسَلْنَا
<lb/>نُوحًا إلىَ قَوْمِهِ We sent Noah unto his people, إِلَيْهِ المَصِيرُ to Him
<lb/>is the returning, ولكن انظر الى الجبل but look toward the
<lb/>mountain, أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَى مُوسَى We revealed i. e. indicated to Moses.
<lb/>Hence, because inclination is implied, إِلَى follows verbs of
<lb/>excusing and repenting; thus تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ I repent toward Thee,
<lb/>مَعْذِرَة إِلَى رَبِّكُمْ it is an excuse to your Lord.
<pb n="165">
<lb/>(b) In respect of time إِلَى usually indicates during a continuance;
<lb/>as إِلَى أَجَلٍ until a fixed term, إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ during
<lb/>all the time till the day of judgement.
<lb/>REM. When used in the above significations, we say that
<lb/>إِلَى is employed لِلاِنْتِهَاء to designate the limit.
<lb/>(c) To show that one thing is added to another we use إِلَى
<lb/>and hence إِلَى آخِرِهِ (see § 23, rem. d) to its end, which is definite
<lb/>but serves for etcetera.
<lb/>452. In addition to implying like إِلَى motion towards an
<lb/>object, حَتَّى must indicate arrival.
<lb/>REM. c. When حَتَّى is a conjunction (see § 367 k) it exercises
<lb/>no governing power upon nouns.
<lb/>453. Whenever possible لِ must be so translated as to indicate
<lb/>abstract relations, those that are concrete being expressed
<lb/>by إِلَى thus إِلَى بَلَدٍ مَيِّتٍ to a dead country, but سُقْنَاهُ لِبَلَدٍ
<lb/>مَيِّتٍ We drove it for the use of a dead country. This distinction
<lb/>cannot always be preserved as is shown by §§ 429 et seq. where لِ
<lb/>indicates an action's relation to the direct object which stands in
<lb/>place of an accusative; thus أَنْصَحُ لَكُمْ or أَنْصَحُكُمْ I advise you
<lb/>(see § 423). More often however we employ لِ
<lb/>(a) for passing on the action to an indirect object; as
<lb/>قَالَ مُوسَى لِقَوْمِهِ Moses said to his people, اِجْعَلْ لَنَا make for us,
<lb/>يُضَاعِفْهُ لَكُمْ he multiplies it to you, اِغْفِرْ لَنَا وَارْحَمْنَا pardon (the
<lb/>sin) to us and have mercy upon us: so with reflexive verbs, which
<lb/>govern self as their direct object; thus لَمَّا تَجَلَّى رَبهُ لِلْجَبلِ
<lb/>when his Lord manifested Himself to the mountain, and we find
<pb n="166">
<lb/>the sense of تجلّى in هِيَ بَيضاءُ لِلنَّاظِرِينَ lo, it is white to
<lb/>the beholders; also by taking praise as the direct object, we may
<lb/>place here يُسَبِّحُ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَواتِ whatsoever is in heaven gives
<lb/>praise to God; and unless wholly idiomatic آمَنَ لَكَ he believed
<lb/>in thee. In these cases لِ and its dependent are not essential to
<lb/>the clause, whereas it is different in
<lb/>(b) the dative (i) of possession; as لَهُ الْمُلكُ وَلَهُ الحمدُ to
<lb/>Him belong the dominion and the praise, لَهُ خُوَار which lows lit.
<lb/>to it is the (power of) lowing, يعكفون عَلَى أَصْنَام لَهُم they cling
<lb/>to their idols, خَيْر لِي better for me, بِنْت لِلْمَلِكِ a daughter of the
<lb/>king (see § 492): (ii) of permission or right; as يُحِلُّ لَهُمُُ الطَّيِبَاتِ
<lb/>he makes lawful to them the good things, آذَنُ لَكَ I give thee permission:
<lb/>(iii) of advantage, contrasting with عَلَى (see § 459 b);
<lb/>as ادعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ pray on behalf of us to thy Lord but دَعَا عَلَيْهِ he
<lb/>cursed him; also هُدًى وَرَحْمَة لِلَّذِينَ a guidance and a mercy
<lb/>for the benefit of those who, واكتُبْ لَنَا فِي هذِهِ الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي
<lb/>الآخِرة and do Thou write for us i. e. place to credit of our account
<lb/>advantage in this world and in the next, لَنَا هذِهِ this is owing to us.
<lb/>REM. b. By use of لِ we express the verb to have, as
<lb/>مَا لِي أَخ I have no brother.
<lb/>(c) Attention is drawn by لِ to the purpose or cause of an
<lb/>act; thus لِمَ for what reason! (see § 351, rem.), وَإِذْ قَالَتْ أُمَّة
<lb/>مِنْهُمْ لِمَ تَعِظُونَ الْقَوْمَ and when a section of them asked, Why do
<lb/>ye warn the people! كِتَاب لِلطُّلاَّبِ a book for the use of students,
<pb n="167">
<lb/>نُصَرِّفُ الْآيَاتِ لِقَوْمٍ We diversify the signs for the use of a people,
<lb/>اُذْكُرْ يَوْمَ يَجْمَعُكُمْ لِيَوْمِ الْجَمْعِ make mention of the day whereon
<lb/>He shall gather you for the sake of (what is in) the day of
<lb/>assemblage (of the angels) i. e. the day of judgement *.
<lb/>REM. Here لِ is employed لِلتَّعْلِيلِ to indicate the cause.
<lb/>(e) Also لِ marks the time of an occurrence; as وَلَمَّا جَآءَ
<lb/>مُوسَى لِمِيقَاتِنَا and when Moses had come to Our appointed time,
<lb/>لأول ليلة من مُحَرَّم on Moslem new year's day lit. at a point
<lb/>of time when a night has passed from Mu&hdotarram †.
<lb/>NOTE. Many verbs indicating a state of mind, friendly or
<lb/>hostile, advantageous or disadvantageous, take لِ of the person
<lb/>towards whom the feeling is directed; thus عَدِيتُ لَهُ I hate him.
<lb/>454. The prepositions indicating rest at a place are فِي in,
<lb/>into, بِ at, in, by, with, مَعَ with, along with, لَدَى لَدُنْ with,
<lb/>beside, near, and عَلَى over, above, upon.
<lb/>We designate by help of فِي
<lb/>(a) rest in a place or during a time, and motion into a place,
<lb/>as لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَواتِ وَمَا فِي الأَرْضِ to Him belongs whatsoever
<lb/>is in heaven and earth, خَلَقَها فِي سِتةِ أَيامٍ He created them in
<lb/>six days, كَتَبْنَاهَا لَهْ فِي الأَلْوَاحِ We wrote it for his benefit upon
<lb/>the tables, لَمَّا سُقطَ فِي أَيْدِيهِمْ when a falling took place into
<lb/>* This rendering is in accordance with Baidâwî.
<lb/>† Further explanation of dates will be found in Wright's Grammar, vol.
<lb/>II. §§ 110 and 111.
<pb n="168">
<lb/>their hands i. e. when they grievously repented, اذْكُرْ مَا فِيهِ
<lb/>remember what is in it, فِي السبت on the sabbath day, ارْسِلْ فِي
<lb/>الْمَدَآئِنِ حَاشِرِينَ send gatherers into the cities. This meaning
<lb/>applies also to less concrete relations, as اغْفِرْ لِي وَلأِخِي وَأَدْخِلْنَا
<lb/>فِي رَحْمَتِكَ pardon (the sin) to me and my brother and cause us
<lb/>to enter into Thy mercy.
<lb/>(b) By rights فِي means in the midst of as may well be seen
<lb/>with a plural or collective; thus قَالَ مُوسَى لِآخِيهِ هرُونَ اخْلُفْنِي
<lb/>فِي قَوْمِي وَأَصْلِحْ Moses said to his brother Aaron, Do thou act
<lb/>as my deputy among my people, and behave uprightly.
<lb/>(c) We use فِي to state the subject of thought, conversation,
<lb/>or writing; thus اَلْكِتَابُ الأَوَّلُ فِي اللغَةِ الْعَرَبِيَّةِ The first book
<lb/>treating of the Arabic language.
<lb/>(d) Further فِي is employed with verbs of desire, as رَغِبَ فِيهِ
<lb/>he liked it.
<lb/>REM. We say that فِي is used لِلظَّرْفيَّةِ to indicate time and place.
<lb/>NOTE. The phrase الأَرْضُ الَّتِي بَارَكْنَا فِيهَا the land which
<lb/>We blessed is equivalent to التِي بَارَكْنَاهَا
<lb/>456. Whereas فِي indicates amongst we more often express
<lb/>with بِ mere proximity; thus مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلِ I passed by a man,
<lb/>بَعَثْنَا مُوسَى بِآيَاتِنَا We sent Moses with Our signs, خُذَهَا بِقُوَّةٍ take
<lb/>it with force, يَطَّيَّرُوا بِمُوسَى they associate bad luck with Moses,
<lb/>لَيْسَ بِي ضَلاَلَة there is in me no error, خَلَقَ السَّمَوَاتِ والأَرْضَ
<lb/>بِالْحَقِّ He created the heavens and the earth rightly. Accordingly
<pb n="169">
<lb/>verbs with certain meanings govern بِ and its dependent in place
<lb/>of an accusative; thus بَصُرْتُ بِمَا لَمْ يَبْصُرُوا بَهِ I saw that which
<lb/>they saw not, لا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيءٍ مِنْ عِلْمِهِ they do not comprehend
<lb/>anything of His knowledge, ثُمَّ لَتُنَبَّؤُنَّ بِمَا عَمِلْتُمْ them ye shall be
<lb/>informed of what ye have done, اَلَّذِينَ يُمَسِّكونَ بِالْكِتَابِ those who
<lb/>hold fast to the book, أَبْتَدِئُ بِسْمِ اللهِ I begin with the name of
<lb/>God; and بِ with its dependent may take the place of a second
<lb/>accusative, thus لاَ تُشْمِتْ بِيَ الأَعْدَآءَ do not cause mine enemies
<lb/>to attach ignominy to me, ذَكِّرْهُمْ بِأَيَّامِ اللهِ remind them of the
<lb/>days of God. Sometimes a verb governs in both ways with the
<lb/>same meaning (see § 423); thus أَخَذَ بِرَأْسِ أَخيهِ he seized the
<lb/>head of his brother, and لا تأخُذُهُ سِنَة وَلاَ نَوْم drowsiness does not
<lb/>seize Him nor sleep; استعينوا بالله ask assistance of God, and
<lb/>إِياكَ نَعْبُدُ وإِيَاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ Thee only do we worship and of Thee
<lb/>alone we ask assistance; ظَلَمُوا بِهَا they treated it unjustly, and
<lb/>مَا ظَلَمُونَا they did not injure Us. Under this general idea of
<lb/>contact are represented the following.
<lb/>(a) The relation between subject and predicate, especially in
<lb/>negative propositions; as مَا نَحْنُ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ we are not believers.
<lb/>(b) The relation between an act and its object, especially
<lb/>after اَلْأَفْعَالُ اللاَّزِمَةُ intransitive verbs; thus يَأْمُرُهُمْ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ
<lb/>he commands the approved to them; آمَنَّا we have believed, but
<lb/>آمَنا بِرَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ we have believed the Lord of the worlds: we
<lb/>notice this particularly after those indicating motion, which must
<pb n="170">
<lb/>then be translated by transitive verbs (see § 423, rem. b); thus
<lb/>ذلك بأنهُ كَانتْ تَأْتِيهِمْ رُسُلُهُمْ بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ this was because their
<lb/>apostles used to bring them proofs, جَاوَزْنَا بِبَنِي إِسْرَآئِيلَ الْبَحْرَ
<lb/>caused the children of Israel to traverse the sea.
<lb/>(c) The relation between an act and its instrument or reason;
<lb/>thus ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللهَ مَوْلَى الذينَ آمنُوا this shall be because God
<lb/>is the patron of those who believe, أَنزلْنَا بِسَحَابٍ المَآءَ فَأَخْرَجْنَا بِهِ
<lb/>مِنْ كُلِّ الثَّمَرَاتِ We caused to descend by means of cloud the
<lb/>water, and we produced by means of it (the rain) all sorts fruits,
<lb/>بِإِذْنِ اللهِ by God's permission, مُسَخَّرَات بِأَمْرِهِ held in subjection
<lb/>by His command, وأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَى مُوسَى إِذِ اسُتَسْقَاهُ قَوْمُهُ أَنِ اضْرِبْ
<lb/>بِعَصَاكَ الْحَجَرَ and We revealed to Moses, when his people asked
<lb/>drink of him, saying (see § 367 e) Strike the stone with thy rod,
<lb/>كذلك نبلوهُمْ بِمَا كَانُوا يَفْسُقُونَ thus We try them by reason
<lb/>of that in which they were impious, واعدْنَا مُوسَى ثَلاثِينَ لَيْلَةً
<lb/>وَأَتْمَمْنَاهَا بِعَشْرٍ We appointed with Moses (a period of) thirty
<lb/>nights and We completed them by means of ten (more), إِنِّي
<lb/>اصْطَفَيْتُكَ عَلَى النَّاسِ بِرِسَالاَتِي وَبِكَلاَمِي verily I have chosen
<lb/>thee above (all) men by reason of (My putting thee in charge of)
<lb/>My messages and because of My speaking (to thee).
<lb/>REM. c. To express without we can use بِغَيْرِ thus الَّذِينَ
<lb/>يَتَكَبَّرُونَ فِي الأَرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ those who behave proudly in the
<lb/>earth without justice.
<lb/>REM. d. Some would place in this sub-section بِسْمِ اللهِ by
<lb/>the name of God while others supply أَبْتَدِئُ as above.
<pb n="171">
<lb/>REM. e. Arabian grammarians have divers expressions to
<lb/>denote the uses of بِ
<lb/>NOTE. We find بِ used in the sense of عَلَى thus ظَنُّوا أَنَّهُ
<lb/>وَاقِع بِهِم they thought that it was falling upon them.
<lb/>457. By help of مَعَ with, along with, we indicate
<lb/>association and connection in time or place; thus أَرْسِلْهُ مَعِي
<lb/>send him with me: there are also less usual meanings.
<lb/>459. We employ عَلَى over, upon above
<lb/>(a) in its local sense; thus وظَلَّنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الْغَمَامَ and We
<lb/>spread for shade over them the cloud, ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى علَى الْعَرْشِ then
<lb/>He established Himself upon the throne: and a similar sense may
<lb/>be discerned in لَمَّا وَقَعَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّجْزُ when the plague fell upon
<lb/>them, وَأَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَنَّ وَالسَّلْوَى and We sent down upon them
<lb/>manna and quail, أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابًا I fear in your case a punishment,
<lb/>عَلَى اللهِ فَلْيَتَوَكَّل الْمُؤْمِنُونَ upon God then let the believers
<lb/>rely الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ those upon whom Thou hast shed blessings.
<lb/>(b) As implying disadvantage (see § 453 b iii); thus غَضِبَ
<lb/>اللهُ عَلَيْهِ God was angry with him, بَعَثَهُ عَلَيْهِمْ he sent him
<lb/>against them. Also we use عَلَى after words signifying difficulty
<lb/>and the opposite; thus يُحَرِّمُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْخَبَآئِثَ he makes unlawful
<lb/>to them the foul things, ذلِكَ عَلىَ اللهِ يَسِير this for God is easy.
<lb/>(c) To express an obligation, thus عَلَى رَسُولِنَا الْبَلاَغُ الْمُبِينُ

<lb/>Christian religion.
<lb/>(i) To indicate the subject spoken of; thus أَنْ لاَ يَقُولُوا
<lb/> عَلى اللهِ إِلاَّ الْحَقَّthat they should not say concerning God other
<lb/>than the truth.
<lb/>REM. a. Other uses exist; as جَآءَكُمْ ذِكْر عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِنْكُمْ
<lb/>an admonition has come to you through one of yourselves.
<lb/>462. With an oath قَسَم we employ وَ by provided a substantive
<lb/>follows and there is no verb of swearing. The complement
<lb/>جَوَابُ الْقَسَمِ may be an affirmative verbal proposition,
<lb/>and the verb may be imperfect in which case ل is prefixed to the
<lb/>energetic form; thus وَرَبِي لَتُبْعَثُنَّ by my Lord, ye shall be raised.
<lb/>463. While commonly reckoned among prepositions كَ as,
<lb/>like is a substantive and synonymous with مِثل likeness (see
<lb/>§ 482 f). We find it in كَذلِكَ كَذَا in like manner, so, and
<lb/>كَأَنَّ as though.
<pb n="173">
<lb/>NOTE. Attached to مَا الْكَافَّةُ the hindering mâ
<lb/>(see § 353*), thus اِجْعَلْ لَنَا إِلهًا كَمَا لَهُمْ آلِهَة make for us a
<lb/>god like their gods.
<lb/>466. To signify at the side of we employ عِنْدَ thus واللهُ
<lb/>عِنْدَهُ أَجْر عَظِيم and with God there is great reward بَمَا عَهِدَ
<lb/>عِنْدَكَ by virtue of the covenant He has made with thee, يَجِدُونَهُ
<lb/>مَكْتُوبًا عِندَهُمْ فِي التَّوْرَاةِ والإِنْجِيلِ they find him written down

<lb/>طَآئِرهم عِنْدَ اللهِ verily the cause of their good and ill luck lies

<lb/>indicate a particular moment, thus أَيْقَنْتُ ‘ِنْدَ كِتَابِهَا I felt sure
<lb/>at the time of writing it.
<lb/>467. Signifying between بَيْنَ indicates an intervening space,
<lb/>thus بَيْنَ الطوفَانِ وَبَيْنَ الهِجْرَةِ between Flood and the Hegira.
<lb/>Of common occurrence is بَيْنَ يَدَيْه between his two hands i. e. in
<lb/>his presence, and بَينَ أَيْدِيهِمْ between their hands. i. e. before
<lb/>them; thus بَيْنَ يَدَيْ رَحْمَتِهِ before his mercy.
<lb/>468. Signifying beneath تَحْتَ indicates the lower part; thus
<lb/>تَحْتَ الشَّجَرَة under the tree.
<lb/>REM. b. Its opposite is وهو القاهر فوقَ عِبادِهِ
<lb/>and He is all-powerful over His servants.
<lb/>469. Signifying below دُونَ often indicates something inferior, and
<lb/>(e) that a quality belonging to one is not possessed by
<pb n="174">
<lb/>another; thus منهم الصالحُونَ ومنهم دونَ ذلَكَ the good are
<lb/>among them and those who are not that are among them.
<lb/>REM. Beside دُونَ تَحْتَ بَيْنَ عِند there are other
<lb/>nouns in the accusative (see §§ 359 and 444 b) which are employed
<lb/>as preposition : for instance,
<lb/>(a) قَبْلَ before of time; thus أأمنتُم بِهِ قَبْلَ أَن آذَنَ لَكْمْ
<lb/>have ye believed. Him before that I gave you permission. Its
<lb/>opposite is بَعْدَ after; thus لاَ يُفْسِدُوا فِي الأَرْضِ بَعْدَ إِصْلاَحِهَا
<lb/>do not ye commit disorders in the earth after its ordering.
<lb/>(c) وَرَآءَ behind, thus اُنْظُرْ وَرَآءَكَ look behind thee: equivalent
<lb/>is خَلْفَ thus يَعْلَمُ مَا بَينَ أَيْدِيهِمُ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ He knows what
<lb/>is before them and what behind i. e what is and shall be.
<lb/>470. Compound prepositions have usually من as the first
<lb/>part, and the second part must be in dependent case. Thus
<lb/>(b) مِن تَحْتِ, as وَيَدْخِلهُ جَناتٍ تَجري من تحتها الأنْهارُ
<lb/>and He shall cause him to enter gardens under which flow the
<lb/>runnels of waters.
<lb/>(c) مِنْ قَبل and مِنْ بَعْد; as من قبل إتْيَانِكَ before

<lb/>(the aforesaid) We sent Moses, بئسمَا خَلفتموني من بعدي

<lb/>السَّيِئَاتِ ثُمَّ تَابُوا مِنْ بَعْدِهَا those who do evil things (and) then

<lb/>REM. c The construction may sometimes be made more
<pb n="175">
<lb/>concise by omission of a preposition; thus واختار موسى قَوْمَهُ
<lb/>سَبْعِينَ رَجُلاً لِمِيقَاتِنَا instead of مِنْ قَوْمِهِ and Moses chose from
<lb/>his people seventy men for Our appointed time.
<lb/>471. The infinitive (see §§195 and 426 to 426) like other
<lb/>nouns is indefinite unless defined by the article or otherwise;
<lb/>thus فِي ذلِكُمْ بَلاء مِنْ رَبّكُمْ عظِيم therein, O you, is a great
<lb/>trail from your Lord; إِنَّ الذِينَ اتَّخّذُوا الْعِجْلَ سَيَنَالُهُمْ غَضَب

<lb/>a god), wrath shall overtake them from their Lord, and ignominy
<lb/>in this present life; قَالُوا مَعذِرَة إلى رَبِّكُمْ they said, It is a way
<lb/>of excusing (ourselves) to your Lord.
<lb/>472. The rection* of nomina agentis has been treated in
<lb/>§§ 430, 431. They and nomina patientis (originally adjectives,
<lb/>see § 80) are frequently used as concrete verbal nouns, designating
<lb/>a person or thing to which the verbal idea closely attaches
<lb/>itself, while remaining immovable. The Imperfect is nearly akin
<lb/>but being part of a finite verb indicates motion or renewal.
<lb/>Note. We retain Professor Wright's term nomen concretum
<lb/>verbale, though it might perhaps be as well to employ the word
<lb/>participle, here and elsewhere.
<lb/>473. For a specific indication of time we must look to some
<lb/>other word in the sentence; thus قَالَ سَنُقَتِّلُ أَبْنَآءَهُمْ وَنَسْتَحْيِ
<lb/>نِسَآءَهُمْ وَإِنَّا فَوْقَهُمْ قَاهِرُونَ he answered, We will massacre their

<lb/>requiring that another word be in a particular case: the corresponding termination
<lb/>is عَمَل action of government.
<pb n="176">
<lb/>sons and we will save alive their daughters (lit. women) and verily
<lb/>we shall be subduers over them, where 	 gives future sense to
<lb/>all three clauses.
<lb/>(a) In a clause which is not circumstantial the concrete
<lb/>verbal noun refers to a present or future time; thus فَلَمَّا كَشَفْنَا
<lb/>عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْزَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ هُمْ بَالِغُوهُ but when We removed from
<lb/>them the plague until a fixed term, which they were about to
<lb/>attain; إِنَّ هَاؤُلآءِ مُتَبَّر مَا هُمْ فِيهِ وَبَاطِل مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ as
<lb/>to these people destroyed is that (religion) in which they were, and
<lb/>rain is is what they were making هُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ فَمِنْكُمْ كَافِر
<lb/>وَمِنْكُمْ مُؤْمِن He it is who created you, and one of you is an unbeliever,
<lb/>and one of you a believer قَالُوا َهْمَا تَأْتِنَا بِهِ مِنْ آيَةٍ
<lb/>فَمَا نَحْنُ لكَ بمُؤْمنين they said, Whatever sign thou bringest to
<lb/>us we do not believe in thee.
<lb/>(b) But the concrete verbal noun in a circumstantial clause
<lb/>refers to the same period of time as the ruling verb; see § 583.
<lb/>The Imperfect Indicative will be found used in nearly the same
<lb/>way; see § 408 e.
<lb/>474. When attached to a verb as adverbial accusative (see
<lb/>§ 444 c) a concrete verbal noun refers to the same period of time
<lb/>as the verb itself; thus اُدْخُلُوا الْبَابَ سُجَّدًا enter the gate prostrating
<lb/>yourselves; يُدْخِلْهُمْ جَنّاتٍ خالدين فيِهَا He shall make
<lb/>them enter gardens to abide therein, an instance of حَال مُقَدَّر &hdot;âl
<lb/>indicating the future.
<pb n="177">
<lb/>475. A noun, when governing another noun in the dependent
<lb/>case, is called by the Arabians مُضَاف annexed, and is said by
<lb/>European grammarians to be in construct state. It is shortened
<lb/>in pronunciation by omission of tanwîn or of the termination نِ
<lb/>and نَ in order that the speaker may pass quickly to the governed
<lb/>word, which is called اَلْمُضَافُ إِلَيْه that to which annexation is
<lb/>made. Their relationship is know as إِضَافة annexation.
<lb/>REM. There are two kinds of annexation الإضافَةُ الحقِيقيَّةُ the
<lb/>proper annexation and الإضافة غيرُ الحقيقية the improper annexation
<lb/>in the former المُضَافُ may be مَعْرِفَة defined or نَكِرَة undefined
<lb/>in the latter it can only be نَكِرَة except when the article
<lb/>is prefixed, see § 489.
<lb/>476. In the construct state of a governing noun, followed
<lb/>immediately by the dependent of a governed, can be represented
<lb/>all ideas which we express in English with the preposition of.
<lb/>Thus سُورةُ الْبَقَرَة the chapter of the cow, حَاضِرَةُ الْبَحْرِ in presence
<lb/>of the sea i. e. situated by the sea, إِنْ يَرَوْا سَبِيلَ الرُّشْدِ if they
<lb/>see the path of true direction. A word may be governing and
<lb/>governed; as مَالِكُ يَوْمِ الدين the Ruler of the day of the judgement,
<lb/>مِيقَاتُ رَبِهِ the appointed time of his Lord أَعَجِلْتُمْ أَمْرَ رَبِكُمْ?
<lb/>478. (a) The governed word المُضَافُ إِلَيْهِ in proper annexation
<lb/>may be nomen substantvum*, a pronoun or other word
<lb/>* We use nomen substantvum here as is § 190, to include primitive
<lb/>nouns, infinitives, and simple substantives.
<pb n="178">
<lb/>regarded as a substantive, or an entire clause (see § 488). Thus
<lb/>سُورَةُ التَّغَابُنِ the chapter of the overreaching, مُوسَى وَقَوْمُهُ Moses
<lb/>and his people والَّذِينَ كَذَّبَُوا بِآيَاتِنَا وَلِقَاءِ الْآخِرَة حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ
<lb/>and those who deny Our sings and the meeting of the last (dwelling),
<lb/>vain are their works كُلُوا مِنْ طَيِبَّاتِ مَا رَزَقْنَاكُمْ eat of the
<lb/>good things which we have provided for you نَبَأُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا the
<lb/>story of those who disbelieved.
<lb/>(b) The governing word الْمُضَافُ i. e. the one in construction
<lb/>state) must in proper annexation be nomen substantivum* in
<lb/>which category are accounted prepositions, as بَعْدَ إِصْلاحِهَا after
<lb/>its ordering; so also are numerals, for which see § 496 et seq.
<lb/>Thus رَبّ هَرُونَ the Lord of Aaron, ذَاقُوا وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِم they tasted
<lb/>the mischief of their doing واللهُ عليم بذات الصدور and God is
<lb/>well acquainted with what is in possession of the breasts. An
<lb/>adjective in construct state is improperly annexed (see § 489)
<lb/>unless, as in the following examples, standing in the position of
<lb/>a defined noun so as to have the force of a substantive; thus
<lb/>حسن الوجه the handsome (part) of the face or even the handsome
<lb/>face, عالمُ الغَيْبِ والشَّهَادَةِ the Knower of the hidden and of the
<lb/>manifest. As regards superlatives, see §§ 486 and 493.
<lb/>REM. a. In proper annexation the article ال can never be
<lb/>prefixed to الْمُضَافُ in the improper it may (see §489).
<lb/>NOTE. The annexed word can be governed by a verb مَحْذُوف
<lb/>eliminated, as يَوْمَ يجمعكم ليوم الجمع ذلك يوم التغابُنِ
<lb/>mention of the day whereon He shall gather you for the day of
<lb/>* We use nomen substantivum here as in § 190, to include primitive
<lb/>nouns, infinitives, and simple substantives.
<pb n="179">
<lb/>assembly, this will be the day of general deception: here we must
<lb/>prefix اُذْكُرْ
<lb/>480. Instead of having an adjectives attached to it, a noun
<lb/>may be in construct state qualified by another noun; as
<lb/>رَجُلُ صِدْقٍ a sincere man : this is common in specifying the
<lb/>material, as عِجْلُ حُلِيٍّ a calf (made) of ornaments.
<lb/>482. The following substantive are used to express the
<lb/>whole, the part, the like and the different, by being annexed
<lb/>مُضَاف to a dependent.
<lb/>(a) كُلّ the totality, the whole. If the leading substantive
<lb/>is defined and signifies something single and indivisible, كُلّ
<lb/>means whole as كُلُّ الْبَيْتِ the whole house; if it is definite but
<lb/>plural or collective, we must render كُلّ all, as كُلُّ الثَمَرَاتِ all
<lb/>the fruits, كُلُّ الْبَقَرِ all the cattle; if it is indefinite كُل means
<lb/>each, every, as إِنْ يَرَوْا كُلَّ آيَةٍلاَ يُؤْمِنُوا بِهَا if they see each
<lb/>sign they will not believe in it, رَحمتي وسعت كُلَّ شَيءٍ My
<lb/>mercy comprises everything. In § 402 a will be found كُلُ أُنَاس
<lb/>every tribe: here, as may be learned from the context, أُنَاس is
<lb/>collective (see § 305, rem. e) but is used as a singular.
<lb/>(b) جَمِيع the totality, the whole much resembles كُلّ; we
<lb/>may however say إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا to you all (see § 444 c. rem. b 2)
<lb/>but not إِلَيْكُمْ كُلاًّ.
<lb/>(d) غَيْر something different may usually be translated other
<lb/>than: thus أعْبُدُوا اللهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِنْ إِلهٍ غَيرُهُ worship God, ye
<pb n="180">
<lb/>have no god other than Him; أغير الله أَبْغِيكُمْ إِلهًا shall I seek
<lb/>for you a god other than God? بَدَّلَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا مِنْهُمْ قَوْلاً غَيْرَ
<lb/>الذي قِيلَ لهُمْ the wrongdoers among them substituted a word,
<lb/>other than that which was told them. For بِغَيرِ without see § 456,
<lb/>rem. c.
<lb/>REM. a. We employ غَيْر as a negative, thus غَيْرُ مُمْكِنٍ impossible;
<lb/>but if repetition be needed we must after the first
<lb/>negative use لا followed alike by a dependent, thus صراطُ الذِينَ
<lb/>أنْعَمْتَ عَلَيهمْ غَير المَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلاَ الضَّالِينَ the way of those
<lb/>upon whom Thou hast shed blessing, other than those who are the
<lb/>objects of (Thine) anger and are in error.
<lb/>(f) مِثْل likeness, like as مِثْلُهُ the like of it, like it.
<lb/>REM. a. Similar in sense to مِثل but without case signs, is
<lb/>كَ see § 463.
<lb/>486. Properly annexed, in construct state, are found deverbal
<lb/>adjectives expressing the superlative, of form أَفْعَلُ (see § 234) or
<lb/>فَعْل (see § 242, note 1) thus وَأنْتَ أَرْحَمُ الرَّاحِمِينَ and Thou
<lb/>art the most merciful of the merciful, وَأَنْتَ خَيْرُ الغَافِرِينَ and
<lb/>Thou art the best of those who pardon. Here one item is made
<lb/>to stand prominently out of a whole designated by the dependent:
<lb/>and being in this annexation definite substantive (see
<lb/>§ 478 b) أَفْعَلُ and فَعْل need not vary in gender or number
<lb/>(see § 493, rem. a), thus أَكْبَرُ المَدَآئِنِ the greatest of the cities,
<lb/>أَحْسَنُهَا the best thing that is in it.
<pb n="181">
<lb/>REM. a. Being superlative أَوَّلُ first stands in annexation of
<lb/>the same sort, thus أنا اولُ المُؤْمنين I am the first of the
<lb/>believers. The other ordinal number ought not so to be used,
<lb/>for they are nomina agentis from transitive verbs, see § 328.
<lb/>488. When أَنْ governs a verb (see § 415 a) it is أَن المصدرية
<lb/>the 'an which with its verb is equivalent to a maçdar (see § 195)
<lb/>and the same construction appertains to the indefinite مَا(see
<lb/>§ 353*). Thus أوذِينَا مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ تَأْتِيَنَا وَمِنْ بَعْدِ مَا جِئْتَنَا we
<lb/>were afflicted before that thou camest to us and after that thou
<lb/>hast come, which is equivalent to مَن قَبْلِ إِتْيَانِكَ إِيَّانَا وَمِنْ
<lb/>بعد مجيئك إِيَّانَا before thy coming to us and after thy coming
<lb/>to us. Clauses of this sort frequently stand as اَلْمُضَافُ إِلَيْهِ (the
<lb/>second member of an annexation, see § 478 a) in lieu of a
<lb/>dependent.
<lb/>489. When improperly annexation the noun in construct state
<lb/>must be an adjectives, thus حَسَنُ الوَجْهِ handsome of face, سَرِيعُ
<lb/>الْعِقَابِ prompt of chastisement. Here the dependent thought
<lb/>always defined by the article exercises no defining influence upon
<lb/>its governing word, which remains نَكِرَة (see § 475, rem.) and
<lb/>can be defined by the article, thus اللهُ السَّرِيعُ العِقَاب God the
<lb/>prompt to punish*.
<lb/>490. Except by poetic licence, nothing can intervene between
<lb/>a noun in construct state and its following dependent, consequently
<lb/>an adjectives qualifying the first member must be placed
<lb/>* This sort of annexation is treated in Wright's Grammar, vol. II. § 30.
<pb n="182">
<lb/>after the second; thus الحمدُ للهِ رَبِ الْعَالَمِينَ الرَّحْمِنِ الرَّحِيمِ
<lb/>praise belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds, the compassionate
<lb/>and merciful.
<lb/>492. In proper annexation if the second member be indefinite
<lb/>the first is the same, as إِني أَخَافُ عليكُم عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ
<lb/>verily I fear in your case a punishment of a great day. But if
<lb/>the second member be definite so is the first, as أَوْرَثْنَا الْقَوْمَ
<lb/>مَشَارِقَ الأَرْضِ وَمَغَارِبَهَا We caused the people to inherit the eastern
<lb/>parts of the land and the western parts of it. If we desire that
<lb/>the first noun be indefinite while the second is definite we must
<lb/>employ the preposition لِ thus ابْن لِلرَّجُلِ a son of the man
<lb/>(see § 453 b, i) : certain words of wide signification may however
<lb/>remain indefinite indefinite even when followed by a definite dependent.
<lb/>493. The examples in § 486 have each its dependent
<lb/>اَلْمُضَافُ إِلَيْهِ definite and therefore partitive : if indefinite the
<lb/>dependent must be explicative as هُنَّ أَفْضَلُ نِسَآءٍ they are most
<lb/>excellent women, اللهُ خَيْرُ حَافِظٍ God is the best preserver. After
<lb/>the superlatives أَوَّلُ first and آخِر last the indefinite dependent
<lb/>is likewise explicative; thus أَوَّلُ آيَةٍ the first verse, آخِرُ يَوْمٍ the
<lb/>last day.
<lb/>REM. a. If the dependent be definite the noun in construct
<lb/>state الْمُضَافُ may resume its characteristic attribute as an
<lb/>adjectives and conform in number and gender to the object or
<lb/>objects mentioned; thus هي كُبرى المدائن it is the largest of
<lb/>the cities, هنَّ كُبْرَيَاتُ الْمَدَائِنِ they are the largest of the cities.
<pb n="183">
<lb/>494. Attention has been drawn in § 480 to a way of specifying
<lb/>the material from which any thing is made: this also may be done
<lb/>by putting the material in apposition to the object, both being
<lb/>either definite or indefinite; thus واتخذ قَوْمُ مُوسَى مِنْ بَعْدِهِ
<lb/>عِجْلاً جَسَدًا and the people of Moses after his departure took for
<lb/>themselves (as god) a calf of red gold.
<lb/>495. Of two things which are identical, the second may be
<lb/>in dependent case and the first in construct state.
<lb/>(b) This happen when a specific noun is preceded by a substantive
<lb/>designating the genus, as سُورةُ فَاتِحَةِ الكِتَابِ equivalent
<lb/>to السُورَةُ الَّتِي هِيَ فَاتِحَةُ الْكِتَابِ the chapter which is the opener
<lb/>of the book.
<lb/>496. It has been mentioned in § 321 that cardinal numbers
<lb/>from 3 to 10, when in apposition to the things numbered, agree
<lb/>with them in case; but when placed in annexation before them
<lb/>(see § 307) must be employed if the substantive have one; thus
<lb/>خلق السموات والأرضَ فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ He created the heavens and the earth in six days.
<lb/>REM. a. Exceptional is مِائَة one hundred which, in dependent
<lb/>singular, always follows the governing numeral, see § 325.
<lb/>REM. b. Should جَمْعُ الْقِلَّةِ the plural of paucity not be in
<lb/>common use, there must perforce be employed جَمْعُ الْكَثْرَةِ the
<lb/>plural of abundance.
<lb/>REM. c. We must remember that a sound plural is plural of
<pb n="184">
<lb/>paucity, thus أَيُهَا سَبْعُ آياتٍ its verses are seven in number;
<lb/>آي is a generic noun which forms a nomen unitatis, being also
<lb/>a plural of abundance, see § 304, No. 28 and § 306, rem. a). If
<lb/>however an adjectives specifies the objects numbered, مِنْ must be
<lb/>employed as in § 448 f; or the noun must be put in apposition to
<lb/>the numeral, thus أَرْبَعَة مُسْلِمُون four Moslems, سِت مُؤمِنَات
<lb/>six believing women.
<lb/>499. We have seen § 444 e, rem. b, that cardinal numbers
<lb/>from 11 to 99 take their objects numbered in the accusative
<lb/>singular; thus اختار مُوسى قَوْمَهُ سَبْعِينَ رَجُلاً Moses chose from
<lb/>his people seventy men, سُورَة مَكِية وَهِيَ ثَمَانِ عَشْرَةَ آيَةً A chapter
<lb/>written at Mecca and it (has) eighteen verses. Very rarely they
<lb/>are followed by an accusative plural, as اثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ أُمَمًا twelve
<lb/>nations. In gender the tens ثَلاُثُونَ عِشْرُونَ etc.) are common;
<lb/>but units conform to the gender of the noun denoting the objects
<lb/>numbered, thus اِنْبَجَسِتِ اثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ عَيْنًا twelve springs gushed
<lb/>out عَيْن being feminine, see § 290 a).
<lb/>506. Cardinal numbers agree in gender with nous denoting
<lb/>the objects numbered according to the following rules; there
<lb/>being objects constantly borne in mind the peculiarity explained at §319.
<lb/>(a) The numeral agrees in gender with the singular of the
<lb/>substantive denoting the objects numbered, even if the plural
<lb/>is of different gender; as خَمسُ سِنين five years (the singular
<pb n="185">
<lb/>سَنَة being feminine), تِسْعَةُ رَمَضَانَاتٍ nine Ramadans (the singular
<lb/>رَمَضَان being masculine), ثَمَانيةَ عشرَ رَجُلاً eighteen men.
<lb/>(b) When the objects numbered are designated by a noun of
<lb/>general signification, its grammatical gender is usually followed
<lb/>by the numeral; as اِثْنَا عَشَرَ أَسْبَاطًا twelve tribes (the sing. سِبْط
<lb/>being masculines more precisely the real gender of the objects, then
<lb/>the numeral agrees with the second noun; thus قَطَّعْنَاهُمُ اثنَتَيْ
<lb/>عَشْرَةَ أَسْبَاطًا أُمَمًا We divided them into twelve tribes (i. e.) nations
<lb/>(the sign أُمَّة being feminine).
<lb/>512. To every جُمْلَة totality, sentence there must be subject
<lb/>and a predicate, the latter being called اَلْمُسْنَدُ that which is
<lb/>supported, the attribute. The subject is called الْمُسْنَدُ إِلَيْهِ that
<lb/>by which (the attribute) is supported, and the relation between
<lb/>them is termed اَلإِسْنَادُ the act of supporting or causing to lean,
<lb/>attribution.
<lb/>513. The subject may be a noun substantive, as قَالَ المَلَأُ
<lb/>مِن قَومه the chieftains of his people answered; or an expressed
<lb/>pronoun, as هُوَ الهُدَى والفُرْقَان it is the guidance and the criterion,
<lb/>هِيَ مَعذرة it is an excuse; or a pronoun مُسْتَتِر concealed
<lb/>in the verb*, as أغْرَقْنَاهُمْ فِي ىلْيَمِ We drowned them in the sea,
<lb/>يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ He giveth life and causeth to die; or a conjunctive
<lb/>*Tables of these pronouns, prefixed and suffixed, are given in Wright's
<lb/>Grammar, vol. I. § 89.
<pb n="186">
<lb/>clause (see § 572), as يُسَبِحُ للهِ مَا فِي السَّمواتِ وَمَا فِي الأَرْض
<lb/>there praises God whatsoever is in heaven and in earth, زَعَمَ
<lb/>الَّذينَ كَفَرُوا the unbelievers have asserted; or a preposition with
<lb/>its dependent, as مِنْهُمُ الصالحثونَ وَمِنْهُمْ دُونَ ذَلِكَ
<lb/>the good are among them, and those who are not that are among
<lb/>them. The predicate may be a noun (substantive or adjectives).
<lb/>asولكني رسول من رب العالمين but I am an apostle from the
<lb/>Lord of the worlds, هو العزيز الحكيم He is the potent, the wise;
<lb/>or a verb as فَلَمَّا أَفَاقَ مُوسَى so when Moses awoke; or a preposition
<lb/>with its dependent, as هُمْ فيه they are in it; or an adverb,
<lb/>as أَنَا هُنَا I am here; or a conjunctive clause, as هُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَكم
<lb/>He is your Creator, هذَا مَا فَعَلَهُ this is what did it or this is
<lb/>what be did. Be the predicate what it may, every sentence
<lb/>beginning with its subject is جُملة اسْمِيَّة a nominal sentence
<lb/>(which may be simple or compound, see §§ 519 and 520), thus
<lb/>هُوَ العَلِيُّ العَظِيمُ He is the sublime, the mighty, إِنَّ الأَرْضَ لِلَهِ
<lb/>surely the earth belongs to God, مُوسَى أَفَاقَ Moses awoke. On
<lb/>the other hand we call جُمْلَة فِعْلِية a verbal sentence (simple or
<lb/>compound) any one in which the predicate is a verb preceding
<lb/>its subject, thus استَغْنَى اللهُ God is self-sufficing, لا يَؤُدُهُ حفظهما
<lb/>the guarding of them both does not wearing Him; or in which the
<lb/>verb represents both subject and predicate, thus تولوا they turned
<lb/>aside. The subject of a nominal sentence is termed المبتدَأُ the
<lb/>inchoative (except when put in the accusative by a preceding إِنَّ
<lb/>for it is then known as اسمُ إِنَّ see § 525 rem.) and its predicate
<pb n="187">
<lb/>الخَبَرُ the enunciative; while the subject of a verbal sentence is
<lb/>called الفَاعِلُ the agent, and its predicate الفعلُ the action or verb.
<lb/>REM. b. Here Professor de Goeje adds the following:—
<lb/>The difference between verbal and nominal sentences, to
<lb/>which the native grammarians attach no small importance, is
<lb/>properly this, that the former relates an act or event, the latter
<lb/>gives a description of a person or thing, either absolutely, or in
<lb/>the form of a clause descriptive of state (see § 583 a). This is
<lb/>the constant rule in good old Arabic, unless the desire to
<lb/>emphasize a part of the sentence be the cause of a change in
<lb/>its position.
<lb/>514. A verb with أَنْ مَا (then called maçdarîyaħ, see
<lb/>§ 488) may serve as subject either to a nominal or to a verbal
<lb/>sentence; thus حَقيق عَلَيَّ أن أَقُولَthat I say so and so is
<lb/>incumbent upon me.
<lb/>515. The predicate may (see §513) be a preposition with its
<lb/>dependent, and when the subject precedes we have nominal
<lb/>sentence; thus العاقبةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ the result is to the devout. If
<lb/>however the preposition and dependent stand first, thus إِلَيْهِ
<lb/>الْمَصِيرُ the returning is to Him (see also next section), we may
<lb/>call the phrase جُمْلَة ظَرْفِيَّة a local sentence (see §§ 221, rem. a
<lb/>and 527 a).
<lb/>REM. The logical emphasis falls upon the later word as in
<lb/>§ 436, rem. b.
<lb/>516. If the predicate be an adverb or a preposition with its
<lb/>dependent, and the subject an indefinite substantive or a clause
<lb/>(see § 514) containing a finite verb governed by أَنْ then the
<pb n="188">
<lb/>predicate must precede, thus أخذ الألْوَاحَ وَفِي نُسْخَتِهَا هُدًى
<lb/>وَرَحْمَة he took the tables and in their inscription were guidance
<lb/>and mercy, لهُ خُوَار it lows lit. a lowing is to it: but either order
<lb/>is permitted if the indefinite substantive carries with it an
<lb/>adjective, expressed or implied, thus لُهُم عّذاب أَلِيم
<lb/>عَذَاب أَلِيم لَهُمْ to them is a a painful punishment. In case of a sentence
<lb/>expressing a wish, however, its subject if indefinite must precede,
<lb/>as سَلام عَلَيْكُمْ peace be unto you; and should the subject follow,
<lb/>it must be defined, thus عَلَيْكُمُ السَّلاَمُ
<lb/>517. The subject also necessarily follows its predicate in
<lb/>a nominal sentence, (a) when the مُبْتَدَأ contains a pronoun making
<lb/>reference to a word in the خَبَر as فِي الدارِ صَاحِبُهَا its master is
<lb/>in the house; (b) when the مُبْتَدَأ is restricted by إِنَّمَا or إلاَّ as
<lb/>أَطيعوا اللهَ وأَطِيعوا الرسولَ فَإِنْ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ فَإِنَّمَا عَلَى رَسُولِنَا الْبَلاغُ
<lb/>الْمُبِينُ obey God and obey the apostle, but if ye turn aside, then
<lb/>only the clear delivery (of his message) is incumbent upon Our
<lb/>apostle, مَا لَنَا إِلاَّ اتِباعُهُ we have nothing (to do) but to follow him
<lb/>(see §§ 585 and 586); (c) when the خَبَر is an interrogative, as
<lb/>مَنْ هُوَ who is heمَا هِيَ what is it? (see § 570).
<lb/>518. In a verbal sentence the agent (i. e. subject) must always
<lb/>follow its verbs (i. e. predicate); thus كَلَّمَهُ رَبُّهُ his Lord spoke to
<lb/>him, يَخْرُجُ نَبَات plants spring up: this it is held to do where a
<lb/>verb represents both subject and predicate; thus أَلْقَى الأْلْوَاحَ
<lb/>he threw down the tables.
<pb n="189">
<lb/>519. In addition to simple sentences, nominal and verbal, we
<lb/>find compound, each consisting of an inchoative with a clause as
<lb/>enunciative. In one sort of compound nominal sentence, a noun
<lb/>(substantive or pronoun) is transposed to the first place and
<lb/>followed by a verb, thus رَحْمَتِي وَسِعَتْ كُلَّ شَيءٍ (as to)
<lb/>My mercy (it) comprise everything. Here the agent of the
<lb/>clause الفَاعِلُ is a concealed pronoun, which corresponds in
<lb/>gender and number with the inhoative of the sentence; and
<lb/>the inchoative contracts (tacitly or expressly) with another
<lb/>inchoative having a different predicate, thus مُوسَى أَفَاقَ
<lb/>وَهرُونُ نَائِم Moses awoke while Aaron was (still) sleeping,
<lb/>إَنَّا هُدْنَا إِلَيْكَ verily as for us, we repent toward Thee, وَلكِن
<lb/>اكثرهم لا يعلمون but most of them do not know, بِأَنَّهُمْ كَذَّبُوا
<lb/>بِآيَاتِنَا because they denied Our signs, لعلكم تُرْحَمُونَ perchance ye
<lb/>may be mercifully dealt with, لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ perhaps ye may be
<lb/>guided aright.
<lb/>520. There are also compound sentences in which a pronominal
<lb/>suffix called اَلرَّابِطُ the connecter replaces the noun
<lb/>transposed. They may be (a) compound nominal, thus اللهُ عِنْدَهُ
<lb/>أَجْر عَظِيم with God there is great reward; or (b) compound
<lb/>verbal, thus البلد الطيب يَخرج نَبَاتُهُ (as to) the good land its
<lb/>herbage comes forth, عذابي أُصِيبُ بِهِ مَنْ أَشَآءُ (as to) My punishment
<lb/>I strike with it whom I will.
<lb/>521. We may regard as verbal a sentence consisting of a
<pb n="190">
<lb/>deverbal adjective and following noun, thus كريم قومكِ thy
<lb/>people are generous (see § 552 b ii).
<lb/>522. There does not exist in Arabic a substantive verb,
<lb/>i. e. one which would unite subject and predicate in a nominal
<lb/>sentence without connoting the idea of existence; for كَانَ though
<lb/>occasionally supplying the place of logical copula, ascribes to its
<lb/>subject the attribute of existence; and being attributive, its
<lb/>predicate and those of أخَواتُ كَانَ must be in the accusative
<lb/>case (see §§ 441 and 442).
<lb/>523. The absence of logical copula expressed by or contained
<lb/>in a finite verb constitutes the essential characteristic of a
<lb/>(simple) nominal sentence (see § 513); so that when a definite
<lb/>noun (substantive or pronoun) and an indefinite adjective stand
<lb/>in juxtaposition we have a complete nominal sentence. The fact
<lb/>of the former being defined (no matter how) and the latter undefined,
<lb/>shows them to occupy the positions of subject and
<lb/>predicate; for, as will be seen in § 536, a descriptive epithet must
<lb/>agree with its noun in respect of definition as well as in gender,
<lb/>number and case. Thus اللهُ غَنِي حَمِيد God is self-sufficing
<lb/>(and) worthy to be praised, سُورَةُ الأعْرَافِ مَكِيَّة the chapter of the uppermost parts is Meccan.
<lb/>524. If both subject and predicate are defined, we can make
<lb/>sure of their relative position being recognized, by inserting
<lb/>between them ضمير الفصل the pronoun of separation; thus
<lb/>أُلائِكَ هُمُ الْمُفلِحُونَ those are the prosperous.
<pb n="191">
<lb/>525. If the predicate be a nominative and the subject placed
<lb/>in the accusative after إِنَّ or the like, a pronoun of separation is
<lb/>unnecessary; thus إِنَّ رَبَّكُمُ الله verily your Lord is God: there
<lb/>may however be inserted such pronoun of the same person as
<lb/>اِسْمُ إِنَّ (see § 436, rem. a); thus إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ وَلِيُّنَا truly Thou art
<lb/>our protector.
<lb/>REM. A noun governed by إِنَّ etc. is not called مُبْتَدَأ inchoative
<lb/>by Arabian grammarians.
<lb/>527. As a general rule the subject of a nominal sentence
<lb/>must, if not exactly defined, be specialized. No information is
<lb/>conveyed by “A horse is grey”; but we can say فَرَس أصفرُ هوَ
<lb/>أَحسن من غيره a grey horse is handsomest, where فَرَس though
<lb/>نَكِرَة indefinite is specialized by its adjective; so also there is
<lb/>obviously a partial determination in رَغْبَة في الشرِّ شَرّ a desire to
<lb/>do evil is bad, and in عَّذاب يوم عظيم مخوف a punishment of
<lb/>a great day is to be feared (see § 492). These examples differ
<lb/>from true definition, which is only attained by use of the article
<lb/>لِلتَعريفِ in order to distinguish (see § 345), or by annexation to
<lb/>a defined noun (see § 475 et seq.): there are other cases where
<lb/>the subject of a nominal clause can be indefinite, among which
<lb/>are the following:—
<lb/>(a) In a clause called at § 515 &zdot;arfîyaħ (i) when the predicate
<lb/>stands first, as مِنَ القَومِ أُمَة there is a section of the people;
<lb/>and (ii) when the subject is preceded by an interrogative or
<lb/>negative particle, as هَلْ مَآء في البِئرِ is there water in the cistern?
<lb/>ما شِرب لَنَا we have no drink.
<pb n="192">
<lb/>(e) When the sentence expresses a wish, as سَلاَم علَيْكُم
<lb/>peace be unto you; see § 516.
<lb/>.(f) Words containing the conditional meaning of إِنْ (see
<lb/>§ 406), though indefinite by their nature, serve as inchoative;
<lb/>thus مَن يؤمن بالله if any one believes God, من يوق شُحَ نفسه
<lb/>whoever is made to guard against his own covetousness.
<lb/>529. A pronoun of separation is sometimes omitted if the
<lb/>meaning remains clear, as ذلك الفوز العظيم this is the great prize.
<lb/>530. To give emphasis and occasion contrast ضَمِيرُ التَّوْكِيدِ
<lb/>أَوِ التَّأْكِيدِ the pronoun of corroboration may be introduced; it
<lb/>being wholly different from the pronoun of separation treated in
<lb/>§524 et seq. Commonly it follows the subject, or a verb which
<lb/>represents both subject and predicate; thus الذينَ هُمْ لِرَبِّهِمْ
<lb/>يَرهَبُونَ those only who fear their Lord, نَكُونَ نَحْنُ
<lb/>WE be the victors; see also للذين هُمْ بِآيَاتِنَا يُؤمِنُونَ at § 415 a i, Note.
<lb/>NOTE. The pronoun of corroboration may follow conjunctive
<lb/>pronouns in an oblique case, thus للذين هُمْ بِآيَاتِنَا يُؤمِنُونَ for
<lb/>those especially who believe in Our signs.
<lb/>531. If however in the description of persons or things (see
<lb/>§513, rem. b) a nominal clause lacks precision, we may use كَانِ
<lb/>or one of its sisters (see §442). When so employed the imperfect
<lb/>has its usual meaning: but a perfect, beside examples like those
<lb/>in § 441, may express the present, as يَضَعُ عَنْهُمْ إِصْرَهمْ وَالأَغْلاَلَ
<lb/>الَّتِ] كَانَتْ عَلَيْهِم he puts away from them their burden and the
<pb n="193">
<lb/>fetters which are upon them; especially is this the case after an
<lb/>interrogative, or مَا not as مَا كُنْت لِأَحْكُمَ بَيْنَكُمْ حَتَى الخ I am
<lb/>not ready to judge between you until etc. (see § 557).
<lb/>533. We have observed in § 73 that passive verbs must often
<lb/>be translated impersonally: commonly a 3rd person singular
<lb/>masculine is used to avoid specifying the subject, thus إِْذ قِيلَ
<lb/>لَهُمْ when it was said to them. In case of غَفَرَ which governs
<lb/>only an accusative of the sin, we render سَيُغْفَرُ لَنَا we shall be
<lb/>pardoned, for it will be pardoned to us gives too explicit a subject.
<lb/>Nomina patientis of verbs which are transitive by help of a preposition
<lb/>(see § 432) can only appear in the masculine singular,
<lb/>changes of gender and number being marked by an alteration of
<lb/>the pronoun; thus هُوَ مَغْضُوب عَلَيْهِ he is an object of anger,
<lb/>هِيَ مَغْضُوب عَلَيهَا she is an object of anger,المغضوب عليهمْ the
<lb/>objects of anger. The neuter plural of adjectives is sometimes
<lb/>expressed by the feminine sound plural, and sometimes by a
<lb/>broken plural, but never by the masculine sound plural; thus
<lb/>وبلوناهم بالحسنات والسيئات and We tested them by means of
<lb/>good and evil things,يُحِلُّ لَهُمُ الطَّيِباتَ وَيْحَرِّمُ عَلَيْهمُ الخَبَآئِثَ
<lb/>he makes lawful to them the pleasant things and makes unlawful
<lb/>to them the foul things.
<lb/>REM. a. The passive of directly transitive verbs may be used
<lb/>personally or impersonally, thus غُلِبَ he was overcome or there
<lb/>was a victory.
<lb/>534. To the subject and predicate complements are joined by
<lb/>subordination (the accusative or a preposition with its dependent),
<lb/>or by coordination which is more usually called apposition.
<pb n="194">
<lb/>535. Pronominal suffixes may have a reflexive meaning when
<lb/>attached to a verb's object, but not when attached to the verb
<lb/>itself; consequently for this purpose we must employ نَفْس soul
<lb/>or the like, thus كَانُوا أَنْفُسَهُم يَظْلِمُونَ they were injuring themselves:
<lb/>to this rule however verbs of the heart (see § 424 b ii)
<lb/>supply exceptions.
<lb/>536. Complements coordinated with a subject or predicate
<lb/>are called تَوَابِعُ appositives (see § 304, No. 16), the usual apposition
<lb/>being of noun to noun and the more rare (see § 540) of
<lb/>verb to verb. There stands first اَلْمَتْبُوعُ that which is followed
<lb/>and then اَلتَّابِعُ the follower.
<lb/>(a) after this fashion the adjective is joined to its substantive;
<lb/>they agreeing in gender, number and case, as well as (see
<lb/>§ 523) by definition or by being undefined: thus ضَلاَل مُبِين
<lb/>manifest error, إِلَى الْبَلَدِ الْمَيِّتِ to the dead country, رَأَيْتُ
<lb/>مَسْجِدَهُمُ الْجَامِعَ I saw their congregational mosque or their
<lb/>mosque which collects, لِقَاءُ الدَّارِ الآخِرَةِ the meeting of the last
<lb/>abode. A noun may of course have two or more adjectives connected
<lb/>with it, thus بسم اللهِ الرَّحْمِنِ الرَّحِيم in the name of
<lb/>God the merciful (and) compassionate: sometimes a nomen verbi
<lb/>(nomen actionis or other) takes the place of an adjective, thus
<lb/>حَال نَكِرَة an indefinite &hdot;âl, اِسْم مَعْرِفَة a defined noun. In the
<lb/>above examples all words are singular, and concords in case of
<lb/>th dual are equally simple: but with plurals the matter becomes
<lb/>difficult, though the rule as to definition is happily unalterable.
<lb/>A substantive (i) in masculine sound plural representing rational
<pb n="195">
<lb/>creatures must be followed by an adjective in the plural, thus
<lb/>بَنُونَ ضَالُونَ erring sons, مُؤْمِنونَ كِرَام (see § 304, No. 5) noble
<lb/>believers, كَافِرُونَ مَلاعِينُ (see § 305, No. 2) accursed unbelievers;
<lb/>while a substantive (ii) in feminine sound plural may be followed
<lb/>by an adjective, singular feminine as رِسَالات حَسَنَة gracious
<lb/>messages, or plural, either broken as جَنَّات كَرَِآئِمُ (see § 304,
<lb/>No. 17) noble gardens, بَقَرَات بِيض (see § 304, No. 2) white cattle,
<lb/>or feminine sound as آيضات مُفَصَّلات signs separated by intervals.
<lb/>A substantive in broken plural if (iii) denoting rational beings
<lb/>may be followed by an adjective in the singular feminine, thus
<lb/>الطُلاَّبُ الإِنْكِلِيزِيَّةُ the English students, رَجَال مُسْلِمَة Moslem men,
<lb/>نِسَآء مُسْلِمَة moslem women, ملوك شدِيدة strong kings, جوارٍ
<lb/>شَدِيدَة strong girls; it is however better, if the sex be indicated,
<lb/>to employ an appropriate sound plural, thus رِجَال مُسْلِمُون and
<lb/>نِساء مسلمَات But if the broken plural (iv) denotes objects
<lb/>other than rational beings, no matter what their gender in the
<lb/>singular, its adjective may be feminine, singular as حِيتَان كَبِيرة
<lb/>great fishes, or plural as صُوَر حَسَنَات beautiful forms; or else
<lb/>a broken plural, thus رِيَاح عِزَاز powerful winds, جِبَال كِرَام
<lb/>noble mountains. Next as regards collectives which are treated
<lb/>in §§ 292 and 306 rem: those (v) denoting rational beings usually
<lb/>take an adjective in that sound plural which corresponds by
<lb/>natural gender with the beings, thus الْقَوْمُ الظَّالِمُونَ the wrongdoers,
<lb/>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا قَوْمًا عَمِينَ truly they were a blind people,
<lb/>حَرِيمُ مَحْمُودٍ الْكَثِيراتُ Ma&hdot;mûd's numeous family; but the
<pb n="196">
<lb/>adjective may be singular and agree with the collective's grammatical
<lb/>gender,thus خَلْف حَسَن excellent posterity, أُمَّة فاسِقَة
<lb/>an impious nation. Collection nouns (vi) which do not form a
<lb/>nomen unitatis and denote living objects destitute of reason (see
<lb/>§ 290 a) are, in respect of concord with adjectives, similar to
<lb/>(see iv) broken plurals denoting irrational creatures : those (vii)
<lb/>which form a nomen unitatis, and denote objects other than
<lb/>rational, may take a feminine sound plural, as جَرَاد طَيَّارَات flying
<lb/>locusts; or a feminine singular, as قُمَّل آكُولَة voracious lice; or
<lb/>a masculine singular, as الثّمَرُ الطَّيِبُ the fresh fruit; or a broken
<lb/>plural, as سحَاب ثِقَال heavy cloud.
<lb/>(b) Being definite by their nature and regarded as substantive,
<lb/>the demonstrative pronouns (see §§ 340, 341) must be
<lb/>coupled with a defined appositive: if this definition is caused by
<lb/>the article we usually find the demonstrative preceding, thus
<lb/>ذلك الفو this prize, هذه القرية this village; but if the substantive
<lb/>be definite in its nature or defined by a following dependent,
<lb/>it must precede, as مَحمود هذا this Ma&hdot;mûd.
<lb/>NOTE. We find in Corân, Sûraħ 7, verse 166 كونوا قردة
<lb/>خاسئين become object apes: here the appositive is in masculine
<lb/>sound plural because human beings are addressed.
<lb/>537. Sometimes we find he adjective أجمَعُ all following a
<lb/>substantive or pronoun and agreeing with it in gender, number
<lb/>and case; thus لأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ I will crucify you all.
<lb/>539. In addition to its use at §535 نَفْس can signify self
<pb n="197">
<lb/>without reflexive meaning, thus رَأَيْتُ نفسه I have seen himself:
<lb/>if a plural be needed, أنفس must be employed.
<lb/>Rem. a. There is a class of appositives called التوكيد or
<lb/>التأَكيد having two divisions; (1) التوكيد المعنويthe corroboration
<lb/>in meaning which includes أجمَعُ جَمِيع كُلّ and
<lb/>نفس with a few other words; and (2) التوكيد اللفظي the verbal
<lb/>corroboration, when any word is repeated, thus نَعَمْ نَعَمْ yes, yes.
<lb/>Rem. b. Three more classes of appositives are in use.
<lb/>(1) الصِفة the qualificative which may refer to its مَتبوع (see
<lb/>§536) directly, in which case it is a simple adjective, thus
<lb/>اللهُ الحي القيوم the living and everlasting God; or indirectly,
<lb/>applying to a following word and with it forming a qualificative
<lb/>clause. (2) البَدَلُ the permutative of which the most usual kind
<lb/>is بَدَلُ الكُلِ مِنَ الكُلِّ the substitution of the whole for the whole;
<lb/>thus اهدنا الصراط المستقيم صراط الذين انعمت عليهم غير
<lb/>المغضوب عليهم direct us (in) the straight road, the road of those
<lb/>upon whom thou hast shed blessing, other than those who are the
<lb/>objects of (Thine) anger. Here صراط is badal of صراط and غير
<lb/>of الذين (3) عطف البيان the explicative connection, being a
<lb/>substantive which explains its مَتبْبُوع thus الرسول النبي the
<lb/>apostle the prophet, قال موسى لأخيه هرون Moses said to his
<lb/>brother Aaron, عجل جسد a calf a body, i. e. a calf in bodily shape.
<lb/>Rem. c. One verb may be substituted for another by بدل
<lb/>الاِشْتِمَال the comprehensive substitution, i. e. the permutative
<pb n="198">
<lb/>explaining something involved in the previous verb; thus
<lb/>يسومونكم سوء العذاب يُقَتَلُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ ويستَحيون نسآءكم they
<lb/>lay upon you the evil of punishment, killing your sons and saving
<lb/>alive your daughters.
<lb/>540. Two verbs used asyndetically (i. e. used without a conjunction)
<lb/>are regarded as in apposition, thus قام سجد he arose
<lb/>and prostrated himself, سجد اطال he continued long in prostration;
<lb/>but the insertion of ف is better.]
<lb/>541. As regards concord in gender and number between the
<lb/>parts of a sentence, the following rules hold good. We shall
<lb/>treat in § 552 of nominal sentences, and at present confine our
<lb/>attention to verbal sentences (see § 518); premising that a masculine singular
<lb/>subject can only be preceded (or followed) by a
<lb/>masculine singular verb, thus قال فرعون Pharaoh said, and that
<lb/>the equivalent of a plural subject (such as a relative sentence,
<lb/>etc.) takes a preceding verb in the singular, thus زَعَمَ الذين كفروا
<lb/>the unbelievers have asserted.
<lb/>542. (a) If the subject be a singular substantive, feminine
<lb/>according to § 290 a, and (i) immediately following its verb, the
<lb/>verb must be feminine singular, thus امتدت يد a hand became
<lb/>extended: but (ii) if one or more words intervene, while the
<lb/>fiminine is better, the masculine is permissible, thus بصرَ بها
<lb/>العَينُ the eye say it.
<lb/>(b) If the subject be a singular substantive, feminine according
<lb/>to §290 b or §291 the verb may precede in either gender,
<lb/>though preferably in the feminine if the subject follows immediately,

<lb/>thus تَمت كلمت ربّكَ the word of thy Lord was fulfilled:
<lb/>but we find فانظُر كيف كان عاقبة المُفْسِدِين so look how was
<lb/>the end of the transgressors.
<lb/>Rem. The concord usually remains if, in negative or interrogative
<lb/>sentences, the subject be preceded by مِنْ but in
<lb/>Corân, Sûraħ 64, verse 11 we have ما أصاب من مصيبة no
<lb/>mischance has befallen.
<lb/>(d) The verbs نِعْم and بئس take preferably the masculine
<lb/>form, be the subject's gender what it may; see §183.
<lb/>543. If the subject be a masculine sound plural the preceding
<lb/>verb is with rare exceptions singular masculine, thus عَلى اللهِ
<lb/>فَلْيَتَوَكَّلِ المُؤْمِنُون upon God then let the believers rely.
<lb/>Rem. b. When meaning family or tribe بَنُون the sound
<lb/>plural of ابْن son, may be preceded by a feminine singular verb;
<lb/>thus آمَنَت بِهِ بَنُو إِسْرَائيل the tribe of Israel believed Him.
<lb/>544. If the subject be a broken plural the preceding verb
<lb/>again with rare exceptions is singular, and of either gender no
<lb/>matter which, thus حبطت أعمالُهُم (from عَمَل masc.) their works
<lb/>are vain, قُطَعَ الأَرْجُلُ (from رجْل fem.) the feet were cut off.
<lb/>But if the broken plural denote male persons the verb is better
<lb/>masculine, thus أَتُهْلِكُنَا بِمَا فَعَل السُفَهَاءُ مِنَّا wilt Thou destroy us
<lb/>on account of what the fools among us have done; though we
<lb/>sometimes find the feminine, as كَانَت تَأتِيهم رُسُل apostles used
<lb/>to come to them.
<pb n="200">
<lb/>545. If the subject be a collective or other noun mentioned
<lb/>in §292 the preceding verb must be singular but may be of
<lb/>either gender; thus قَالَ الْمَلَأُ the chiefs said, استسقاهُ قومه his
<lb/>people asked drink of him,وإذ قالت امه مِنهم and when a section
<lb/>of them said.
<lb/>546. If the subject be a feminine sound plural the preceding
<lb/>verb must be singular but may be of either gender, unless denoting
<lb/>female persons, in which case the feminine is preferable.
<lb/>458. When the subject has been mentioned in a preceding
<lb/>clause, the verb must agree with it in gender and number
<lb/>according to the following rules. A masculine or feminine singular
<lb/>verb follows a like subject; and a masculine plural verb
<lb/>follows a masculine sound plural, thus سفر المسلمون وأتوا the
<lb/>Moslems journeyed and came, as also the plural of pronouns, thus
<lb/>فإذا جَآءَتُهُم الحسنة قالوا and when the boon came to them they
<lb/>said. In case of broken plurals the following verb must be feminine,
<lb/>singular or plural, thus يرسل الرياح وأقلت سَحَابًا He sends
<lb/>the winds and they bear cloud where اقللن might also have been
<lb/>used: if however male persons are indicated the verb in masculine
<lb/>plural is used, thus جاء السحرة فرعون وقالوا the magicians
<lb/>came to Pharaoh and said; or if female persons the verb is in
<lb/>feminine plural. Following a collective noun which indicates a
<lb/>predominance of male persons the verb is naturally in masculine
<lb/>plural, thus من قوم موسى امة يهدون باحلق وبه يعدلون among
<lb/>the people of Moses there is a section who direct (others) by the
<lb/>truth and by means of it do justice, خلف خلف ورثوا الكتاب a
<lb/>posterity succeeded who inherited the Book: other collectives
<pb n="201">
<lb/>treated in § 292 are followed by a singular verb of either gender.
<lb/>Lastly if the subject be a feminine sound plural the verb would
<lb/>naturally follow in feminine plural though the feminine singular
<lb/>occurs, thus آمَنَّا بِآيَاتِ رَبَنَا لَمَّا جَآءَتْنَا we believed the signs of our
<lb/>Lord, when they came to us: but when female persons are indicated
<lb/>the concord must be strictly kept.
<lb/>551. a verb sometimes agrees in gender with the logical
<lb/>subject, i. e. a dependent annexed to the grammatical subject;
<lb/>this is most usual with words explained in §482, thus ولو جاءتهم
<lb/>كُلُّ آيةٍ even though every sign come to them.
<lb/>552. In nominal sentences the concord of gender and number
<lb/>between subject and predicate closely resembles that in verbal sentences.
<lb/>(a) When the predicate, being verb or adjective, follows its
<lb/>subject, they must agree strictly in gender and number; thus
<lb/>الله أعلمُ مِنْ غَيْرِهِ God knows best lit. is ore knowing than any
<lb/>other, فَإذا هي تتلقف ما يأفكون so behold it swallows up what
<lb/>they cause to put on a false appearance, هم بالغوه they are
<lb/>attainers of it, لعلهم يرجعون perhaps they may repent, لَعَلَّكُم
<lb/>تَتَّقُون perchance ye will take heed to yourselves; but a broken
<lb/>plural may be followed by a feminine singular, as الحيتان كبيرة
<lb/>the fishes are large.
<lb/>(b) When the predicate precedes its subject, as in negative
<lb/>and interrogative sentences, (i) they must in a nominal sentence
<lb/>agree (see c) but (ii) in a verbal sentence (see §251) the predicate
<lb/>ought to be singular, thus أمين الصَّادِقُون the truthful are trustworthy.
<pb n="202">
<lb/>(c) If subject be collective its predicate may follow in the
<lb/>plural, thus الأَهْلُ جاهلُونَ the people are ignorant. Similarly,
<lb/>when a verb is placed after a collective subject, thus أَبَشَر ْ يَهدونَنَا
<lb/>shall men direct us?
<lb/>(d) A predicate frequently agrees in gender with the logical
<lb/>subject, i. e. a dependent annexed to the grammatical subject,
<lb/>compare §551.
<lb/>553. In negative and prohibitive sentences as negation may
<lb/>apply to any part of the sentence—the predicate, the subject (see
<lb/>§439), the object, the circumstantial expression الْحَالُ etc.
<lb/>554. The negative most often immediately precedes that part
<lb/>of the sentence which it denies, but this is not necessarily so.
<lb/>555. (a) The predicate of a verbal sentence in the imperfect
<lb/>with present sense may be denied by لاَ (see §362 dd), as لا يَؤُودُهُ
<lb/>حَفظُهمَا the guarding of them both does not weary Him; or with
<lb/>the future sense, as إَنا لا نضيع أجر المُلِحِين surely We will
<lb/>not allow to be lost the reward of the righteous; or with a past
<lb/>sense, when preceded by a verb which expresses the past, as
<lb/>ألم يروا أنه لا يُكلِمهم did they not perceive that it could not
<lb/>speak to them?
<lb/>(b) We rarely find لاَ attached to a verb in the perfect, except
<lb/>when used with و to continue a previous negation.
<lb/>556. The particle لَن (for لا أَن see §362 hh) is a very strong
<lb/>negation of the future, as can be seen in §§412 and 415 ai.
<lb/>Rem. For لم and لَمَا see $ 412 and 418.
<pb n="203">
<lb/>557. The particle ما not (see §362kk) denies the perfect
<lb/>when the latter has one of the meanings treated in §401 a to d;
<lb/>when joined to the imperfect it denies the present, as is noted
<lb/>in §408 e, rem. a.
<lb/>Note. An instance of مَا denying كَانَ is given is §531.
<lb/>558. The particle إِنْ not (see §362 k) beside being found
<lb/>in nominal sentences, thus إن هِيَ إِلاَّ فتْنَتُكَ this is only Thy
<lb/>temptation, may be used before the imperfect indicative and the
<lb/>perfect of a verb.
<lb/>559. The verb ليس (see §§182 and 442) which usually
<lb/>expresses the indefinite or definite present (see §408 a, b) is
<lb/>commonly ناقِصَة incomplete, as لست بِنَاظرٍ لَسْتُ نَاظِرًا I am
<lb/>not an onlooker; though it may by تَامَّة complete. It is also
<lb/>employed as an indeclinable particle, denying more strongly than
<lb/>لاَ that part of the sentence to which it is prefixed.
<lb/>560. When a sentence containing one of the negatives لَمْ مَا
<lb/>لَنْ لَمَّا or ليس is followed by another negative sentence, with
<lb/>و and to connect the two, (a) the sound sentence is negatived
<lb/>by لا when no special emphasis attaches to the form of negation,
<lb/>and (b) the first negative is repeated when the independence of
<lb/>the second sentence is emphasized; but (c) when the two verbs
<lb/>are conceived of as forming parts of one action, on second negative
<lb/>is required, thus إِن لم يرحمنا ربنا ويغفر لنا if our Lord
<lb/>had not been merciful to us and pardoned us.
<lb/>Rem. a. As regards the use of لا instead of repeating غير
<lb/>see §482 d, rem. a.
<pb n="204">
<lb/>563. The prohibitive لا governs the jussive, as may be seen
<lb/>in §§417 and 420: this happens also with the energetic.
<lb/>564. All interrogative clauses take the direct form, thus
<lb/>أَتَكْتُبُ اللغةَ العربية canst thou write Arabic? سَألَ اتَكْتُبُ اللغَة
<lb/>الْعَرَبيَّةَ he inquired whether thou couldst write Arabic; the
<lb/>difference between direct and indirect questions being ignored,
<lb/>both in the arrangement of words and in the moods of the verb.
<lb/>565. Spoken questions may be indicated merely by the tone
<lb/>of voice: but written inquiries are usually introduced by one of
<lb/>the following particles, viz. أ أَلاَor هَلْ unless provide with
<lb/>an interrogative adverb, such as أَيْنَ where?. كَيْفَ how? or the
<lb/>like (see §§361 to 364).
<lb/>566. The simplest interrogative is thus أَعَجِلْتُمْ أَمْرَ رَبِّكُم
<lb/>have ye hastened the affair of your Lord? This particle may be
<lb/>prefixed to إِنَّ or وَ thus أَئِنَّ لَنَا لَأَجْرا (see §361 a,
<lb/>rem.) shall there indeed be to us a reward? أَوَعَجِبْتُمْ do ye wonder?
<lb/>أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ do ye not therefore understand?
<lb/>567. The interrogative هَلْ introduces questions of a more
<lb/>lively sort, thus هَلْ يُجْرَوْنَ إِلاَّ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ shall they be
<lb/>rewarded otherwise than with they have been accustomed to
<lb/>do. Upon the use of this particle there are certain restrictions.
<lb/>568. The particle أَلاَ (originally meaning is it not the case
<lb/>that?) affirms a certainty, thus أَلاَ لهُ الخلق truly to Him
<lb/>belongs the (whole) creation. It is frequently followed by a
<pb n="205">
<lb/>further asseverative, e. g. إِنَّمَا thus أَلاَ إِنَّمَا طَائِرُهُم عِنْدَ اللهِ
<lb/>verily their luck (or fate) is in the hands of God only.
<lb/>570. The interrogative pronouns مَن who? and ذَا what? (see
<lb/>§351) may stand in any one of the three cases, nominative,
<lb/>dependent, or accusative. To render the interrogative more
<lb/>vigorous we append the demonstrative pronoun ذَا (see §340)
<lb/>thus فَمَا ذَا تَأْمُرُونَ so what do ye enjoin? and this may happen
<lb/>when الذي follows, thus من ذا الذي يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ who is he that
<lb/>shall intercede with Him? The pronouns مَنْ and are always
<lb/>used substantively, but cannot govern a dependent or be followed
<lb/>by a substantive in apposition.
<lb/>Rem. d. As to مَ for مَا see §351, rem.
<lb/>572. There are two kinds of relative sentences; (a) that
<lb/>called صِفَة a qualificative which is immediately attached to an
<lb/>indefinite substantive without intervening pronoun, and (b) that
<lb/>called صِلَة a conjunctive, where introduction is made by a
<lb/>pronoun which is definition in its nature The conjunctive pronoun
<lb/>(see §346) is called الموصول that which is joined, i. e.
<lb/>joined to الصِلَة the conjunctive clause. As examples (a) the
<lb/>following are indefinite clause; أُمَّة يُهْدُونَ بالحقِ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُون
<lb/>a nation who direct (others) by means of the truth and who by it
<lb/>do justice, فأتوا على قومٍ يَعْكُفون على أَصْنَامٍ لَهُمْ so they came
<lb/>upon a people who clung to their idols: (b) the following clauses
<lb/>are definite; واسألْهُمْ عِنِ القريةِ الَّتِي كَانَتْ حاضرةَ البَحرِ and
<lb/>ask them concerning the village which is situated by the sea,
<pb n="206">
<lb/>الذين يتقون ويؤتون الزكاة those who take heed to themselves
<lb/>and give the appointed alms, موسى وَمَنْ مَعَهُ Moses and he who
<lb/>is (or those who are) with him, ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ بِمَا عهدَ عِنْدَكَ
<lb/>entreat thy Lord on our behalf by virtue of that which he has
<lb/>covenanted with thee.
<lb/>REM. a. When the antecedent substantive is indefinite we
<lb/>cannot in Arabic employ a conjunctive pronoun; for الذي is
<lb/>(see § 347) always definite, while مَنْ and مَا though sometimes
<lb/>indefinite (see §§ 353* and 527 f) are always used substantively.
<lb/>REM. b. follows the next section.
<lb/>REM. c. Among qualificative clauses may be accounted those
<lb/>mentioned in § 539, rem. b 1.
<lb/>573. The qualificative clause (الصِفَةُ) necessarily contains
<lb/>a pronoun (called الْعَائد) referring to the qualified noun and
<lb/>connecting it with the said qualificative clause. This 'â'id, in
<lb/>case the clause be verbal, is a pronoun concealed (see § 513) in
<lb/>the verb; as حَاشِرُونَ gatherers who (they) come to thee,
<lb/>خَلَفَ خَلْف وَرِثُوا الكتاب a posterity followed who (they) inherited
<lb/>the Book: in case the clause be nominal, a separate pronoun is
<lb/>employed; as نَبِي هُوَ صاحِبُكَ a prophet who (he) is thy
<lb/>companion. Frequently the 'â'id appears as suffix in the
<lb/>accusative, thus هذا مكر مكرتموهُ this is a plot which ye have
<lb/>contrived, or in the dependent, as قَوْم اللهُ مهلِكُهُمْ a people of
<lb/>whom God is the destroyer, إلى أجل هم بالغوه until a fixed term
<lb/>which they were about to attain. If however no 'â'id is needed
<lb/>to make clear the meaning, it may be omitted; thus يوم يجمعكم
<pb n="207">
<lb/>(make mention of) the day on which He shall assemble you, whence
<lb/>فِيهِ is eliminated.
<lb/>REM. In theory a 'â'id ought to be of the 3rd person, but in
<lb/>practice it often agrees with the subject to which the qualified
<lb/>substantive is predicate; thus إِنَّكُمْ قَوْم تَجْهَلْونَ verily ye are
<lb/>a people who (ye) are ignorant. Compare § 575, rem. a.
<lb/>574. The conjunctive clause (الصِلَةُ) must begin with a conjunctive
<lb/>pronoun. Now it has been shown in § 346 et seq.
<lb/>that, like من and ما when definite, الذي is used substantively
<lb/>to mean he who, that which; thus الذي خبث that which was
<lb/>bad, الذين يتبعون الرسول النبي الأُمِيَّ those who follow the
<lb/>apostle, the illiterate prophet. Only الذي can be used adjectively,
<lb/>and then like all adjectives it agrees with its antecedent, a definite
<lb/>substantive, in gender, number and case, its agreement in case
<lb/>being best shown by the dual which has case-endings: thus
<lb/>أرِنَا الشَّيْطَانَين اللذين أَضلانا show us the two devils who led us
<lb/>astray, where اللذين is oblique (for the accusative) agreeing
<lb/>with الشيطانين; again أرنا الشيطانينِ اللَّذَينِ هُمَا مُضِلاَّنَا show
<lb/>us the two devils who lead us astray. In both these examples the
<lb/>real subject in the relative clause is the pronoun called 'â'id, as
<lb/>will next be explained.
<lb/>NOTE. Whether used substantively or adjectively الذين can
<lb/>only apply to masculine rational creatures, compare § 302, rem. a.
<lb/>575. The preceding section shows that Arabic conjunctive
<lb/>pronouns are not used quite like our English relative pronouns;
<lb/>for the case in which they are put is independent of the conjunctive clause.
<pb n="208">
<lb/>If standing first as substantives and forming
<lb/>the subject of an independent sentence, they are in the nominative;
<lb/>as is الَّذِي when attached adjectively to a substantive in
<lb/>the nominative, But in every other instance, though at the
<lb/>beginning of a conjunctive clause, they are subject to government
<lb/>by an antecedent, whether noun, verb or particle: consequently
<lb/>they are in the particular case which their position requires,
<lb/>viz. either, that case occupied by the demonstrative pronoun
<lb/>implied in them, thus بَمَا فَعَلَ by reason of THAT which he has
<lb/>done; or, the same case as the antecedent substantive with which
<lb/>they agree, thus فآمنوا بالنورِ الذِي أَنْزَلْنَا so believe the light
<lb/>which We have sent down. To elucidate this difficult matter we
<lb/>have employed in the first instance two examples which do not
<lb/>display الضمير العائدُ the pronoun which refers back, and we now
<lb/>propose showing to what use it serves in (a) the nominative case,
<lb/>(b) the accusative, and (c) the dependent.
<lb/>(a) If a 'â'id stand in the nominative as subject, it is
<lb/>represented (i) in a verbal sentence by the personal pronoun
<lb/>concealed in the verb, thus بعَثَ مَنْ ضَرَبَهُمْ he sent him who
<lb/>struck them, اتبعوا النور الذي أُنْزِلَ مَعَه they followed the light
<lb/>which has been sent down with him, أَنْجَينَا الذين ينهون عن السوء
<lb/>وأخذنا الذين ظلموا بعذاب بئسٍ We delivered those who were
<lb/>forbidding the evil and We visited with grievous punishment those
<lb/>who were unjust. But (ii) in a nominal sentence the 'â'id is
<lb/>expressed by a separate pronoun, as مَا هوَ طَيِب that which is
<lb/>sweet smelling or whatever is sweet smelling. The separate
<lb/>pronoun however (iii) is not required in a nominal sentence
<pb n="209">
<lb/>when the predicate is an adverb, as ضربت من هنا I struck
<lb/>the one who is here; or a preposition with its dependent, as
<lb/>درسوا ما فيه they studied what is in it, فأنْجيناه والذين معه
<lb/>في الفُلْكِ so We saved him and those who were with him in the ark.
<lb/>(b) If the 'â'id be an objective complement in the accusative,
<lb/>it is appended as suffix to its verb, thus الذي يَجِدُونَهُ he whom
<lb/>they find, خذ ما آتيناهُ للنبي take what we have given to the
<lb/>prophet. The suffix however is very frequently eliminated, thus
<lb/>مَن أَشَآء whom I wish for مَنْ أَشَآءُهُ he (or مَن أَشَآءُهُم they) whom
<lb/>I wish, مَا كاَنُوا يعرشون what they were constructing, اللهُ بِمَا
<lb/>تَعْمَلُونَ بَصير God is able to see what ye do.
<lb/>(c) When in dependent case the 'â'id represents our relative
<lb/>pronouns, standing in cases other than the nominative and
<lb/>accusative. Thus الذين أنعمتَ عليهم those upon whom Thou
<lb/>hast shed blessings, الذي له ملك السموات والأرضِ He to Whom
<lb/>belongs the dominion over heaven and earth, فَلَما نسُوا مَا ذَكِّرُوا بِهِ
<lb/>and when they forgot that of which they had been reminded,
<lb/>مَا هُمْ فِيهِ that in which they are. There are occasions on which
<lb/>a 'â'id may be omitted, as for instance when it and the preceding
<lb/>conjunctive pronoun are governed by the same preposition, as
<lb/>عَتَوْا عَمَّا عَتَا they turned in disdain from that from which he
<lb/>turned in disdain where عَنْهُ is eliminated: but omission is not
<lb/>permissible if the preposition be used in two senses, or if it
<lb/>follow different verbs, thus فَلَمَّا عَتَوْا عَمَّا نُهُوا عَنْهُ so when they
<lb/>turned in disdain from that from which they were forbidden.
<pb n="210">
<lb/>REM. a. In theory a 'â'id after الذي ought to be of the 3rd
<lb/>person but it is not so always: compare § 573, rem.
<lb/>NOTE. In relation to a 'â'id مَهْمَا exactly resembles مَا bus
<lb/>مهما تَأْتِنَا بِهِ مِن آيَةٍ whatever thou bringest us of a sign.
<lb/>576. Copulative sentences require وَ or فَ (see § 366) of
<lb/>which the former is used to connect words and clauses as a
<lb/>simple co-ordinative; thus عََّرُوهُ وَنَصَرُوهُ they have helped him
<lb/>and assisted him, لِيُنْذرَكُمْ وَلتَتَّقُوا in order to warn you and that
<lb/>ye may take heed to yourselves, سحروا أعين الناسِ واسترهَبُوهُمْ
<lb/>they bewitched men's eyes and terrified them, غُلِبُوا هُنَالِكَ
<lb/>وانقلبوا صاغرين they were overcome there and were rendered
<lb/>contemptible. The particle ف however sometimes unites single
<lb/>words as is noted in § 540, but more usually it connects
<lb/>two clauses showing either (a) that the latter is immediately
<lb/>subsequent to the former in time, or (b) that the clauses are
<lb/>linked internally as for instance by cause and effect: thus (a)
<lb/>صوركم فأحسن صوركم He fashioned you, and them He beautified
<lb/>your forms; ألقى عصاهُ فإِذَا هِيَ ثُعْبان مُبِين he threw down
<lb/>his rod, and behold it became a serpent manifest; اختارهم
<lb/>فلما اخذتهم الرجفة قال رب he chose them, and when the
<lb/>convulsion seized them, he said, O my Lord; (b) يحيى ويميت
<lb/>قآمنوا بالله ورسوله والنبي الأمي الذي يؤمن بالله وكلماته 
<lb/>واتبعوه (because) He gives life and cause to die, therefore believe
<lb/>God and His apostle, the illiterate prophet, who believes God
<lb/>and His words; also follow him. When فَ means because it is
<pb n="211">
<lb/>usual to employ فَإِنّ thus اهبطُوا مِصْرًا فَإِنَّ لَكُمْ مَا سَألْتُمْ 
<lb/>go down into Egypt for (there) shall ye find what ye ask. We
<lb/>have seen in §§ 415 d, 417 c and rem. c, that فَ may be used
<lb/>to separate an apodosis from its protasis: after the disjunctive
<lb/>particle أَمَّا (see § 367 d) فَ must always introduce the apodosis,
<lb/>thus أَما من آمن وعمل صالحًا فله جزاء الحسنى as to whoso
<lb/>believes and does right, he shall have a most excellent reward.
<lb/>577. If a second subject be added to the concealed pronoun
<lb/>which serves as subject to the verb, we must employ a separate
<lb/>personal pronoun in repetition of the latter, thus قلنا يا آدم
<lb/>اسكن انت وزوجكَ الجنَة We said, O Adam, dwell thou and
<lb/>thy wife in the garden; but اسكنها وزوجك is permissible.
<lb/>578. If after a pronominal suffix expressing the object a substantive
<lb/>be connected by وَ we may employ a separate personal
<lb/>pronoun in repetition of the suffix, thus أَرْجِهِ هُوَ وأَأخَاهُ put him
<lb/>off and his brother; but this is not usual. Also we may write
<lb/>أَرْجِهِ وَأَرْج أَخَاهُ or we may employ إِيَّا (see § 189 a) thus
<lb/>أَرْجِ أَخَاهُ وَإِيَّاهُ put off his brother and him.
<lb/>579. We must repeat a preposition, if with its pronominal
<lb/>suffix a substantive is connected by وَ; thus اغفر لي ولأخي
<lb/>pardon (the sin) to me and my brother.
<lb/>580. When preceded by و connecting two nouns, لا represents
<lb/>all the antecedent negative sentence except that word for which
<lb/>the noun-that follows لا is substituted; thus لاَ تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَة وَلاَ نَوم
<lb/>drowsiness doth not seize Him nor sleep: here ولا represents ولا تاخذه.
<pb n="212">
<lb/>582. The copulative particles are sometimes used in Arabic
<lb/>in place of an English disjunctive or adversative; thus قَالُوا
<lb/>نُؤْمِنُ بِمَا أنزلَ علينا ويكفرون بِما وَراءه وهو الحق they say,
<lb/>We believe what has been sent down to us, and they ignore what
<lb/>(has come) after it, although it is the truth. We have noted
<lb/>in § 540 the use of فَ between two verbs, the second of which
<lb/>modifies the first.
<lb/>583. Mention has been made in § 444 c, rem. c 4, of
<lb/>جُمْلَة حَالِيَة a circumstantial clause, which will commonly be
<lb/>found meaning whereas or seeing that. Here و serves to connect
<lb/>two clauses the second of which describes the state or condition
<lb/>either of the subject or other part of the first clause, or else of a new subject.
<lb/>(a) The circumstantial clause may be nominal (see § 513) as
<lb/>أَغير الله أَبغيكم إِلهًا وهو فضلكم علي العالمين shall I seek for
<lb/>you a god other God, whereas He has favoured you above all
<lb/>creatures: here the second clause refers to الله and is compound
<lb/>nominal (see § 519) having a finite verb for its predicate.
<lb/>(b) The circumstantial clause may be verbal and affirmative,
<lb/>its verb being in imperfect indicative preceded by وَقَد Without
<lb/>قد we must not employ حال مقدر and by omission of both we obtain
<lb/>sentences like the examples in § 408 d where the second clause
<lb/>is حال مقدر &hdotâl indicating the future; or like those in § 408 e
<lb/>whose second clause is حال مُقارن a contemporaneous stạte.
<lb/>(c) The circumstantial clause may be verbal and negative, its
<lb/>verb being in imperfect indicative preceded by وَمَا or in the
<pb n="213">
<lb/>jussive preceded by وَلَم thus خَلَقْتُكَ
<lb/>I created thee beforehand when thou wast nothing. If لا be used,
<lb/>وَ is nearly always omitted, and not seldom in other cases.
<lb/>(d) The circumstantial clause may be verbal and affirmative,
<lb/>its verb being in the perfect usually preceded by وَقَد; thus
<lb/>هو على هين وقد خلقتك من قبل it is easy for Me, seeing that
<lb/>I created thee heretofore.
<lb/>(e) The circumstantial clause may be verbal and negative, its
<lb/>verb being in the perfect preceded by وَمَا or even by مَا alone:

<lb/>584. Adversative, restrictive and exceptive sentences call for notice;
<lb/>the commonest adversative particles being لا and كن or لكِنَّ.
<lb/>(a) We employ لاَ (see § 362 dd) in opposition to a preceding
<lb/>affirmative proposition or command; thus قِيلَ لموسى كليم الله
<lb/>لا لهرون Moses, not Aaron, was called the interlocutor of God.
<lb/>(b) We use لكن and لكِنَّ (with or without وَ see § 362 ee)
<lb/>in opposition most frequently to a preceding prohibition or

<lb/>negative statement: لَن تراني ولكن انظر الى الجبل thou shalt
<lb/>not see Me, but look toward the mountain; ليس بي ضلالة ولكِنِّي
<lb/>رَسُول there is in me no error, but I am an apostle.
<lb/>585. We have mentioned إِنَّمَا at § 436, rem. d, this word
<lb/>being most commonly restrictive (see § 362 n). It is usually
<lb/>placed at the beginning of a proposition, and that portion of
<lb/>the proposition which it affects must stand at the end; thus
<lb/>إِنَّمَا طَآئِرُهُمْ عِنْدَ اللهِ their luck (or fate) is at the disposition
<lb/>of God only; see § 517 for a restricted incohative.
<lb/>586. Exception (الاِسْتِثْنَآءُ) is of three kinds; الْمُتَّصِلُ the
<lb/>joined, in which الْمُسْتَثْنَى the thing excepted is similar in kind
<lb/>to the general term (المستثنى مِنهُ that from which exception
<lb/>is made) as لا إِله إِلا هُوَ there is no god except He; الْمُنْقَطِعُ the
<lb/>severed, in which the thing excepted is differernt in kind from
<lb/>the gerneral term, as مَا قَامَ القَوْمُ إِلاَّ حِمَارًا the people did not
<lb/>stand up but an ass; and الْمُفَرَّعُ the emptied, where the general
<lb/>term is not expressed, as مَا تَنْقِمُ مِنَّا إِلاَّ الخ thou dost not resent
<lb/>(any action) on our part except etc.
<lb/>(a) The commonest of exceptive particles is إِلاَّ (see § 367 f)
<lb/>in employing which the following rules are observed.
<lb/>(i) After an affirmative proposition containing the general
<lb/>term, a thing excepted must be in the accusative; thus سَجَدَ
<lb/>الملائِكةُ إِلا إِبْلِيسَ the angels prostrated themselves except Eblis.
<lb/>(ii) After a negative proposition containing the general term,
<lb/>a thing excepted is best placed in same case with the general
<pb n="215">
<lb/>term; thus إِنْ هِيَ إِلاَّ فِتْنَتُكَ this is nothing but Thy
<lb/>temptation, لا إِله إلا اللهُ there is no god but God (where إِلهَ is
<lb/>virtually nominative though grammatically accusative, see § 439).*
<lb/>The same holds with propositions implying a negative, which are
<lb/>usually interrogative (اسْتِفْهَام إِنْكَارِي a negative interrogative);
<lb/>thus وَمَنْ يَغْفِرُ الخَطِيئَاتِ إلاَّ اللهُ and who forgives sin except God?
<lb/>The general term may be a preposition with its dependent, as
<lb/>مَا أَصَابَ مِن مُصِيبَةٍ إِلاَّ الخ no mischance has befallen except etc.
<lb/>مِنْ مُصِيبَة being equivalent to مُصيبة and the thing excepted
<lb/>follows the general rule in respect of case. When the general
<lb/>term is not expressed, we must give to the thing excepted
<lb/>that case in which the general term should be; thus مَا لَنَا
<lb/>إِلاَّ حِطة we have nothing to do but to unload whence شَيْ is
<lb/>eliminated, لاَ يَقُولُونَ عَلى اللهِ إِلاَّ الْحَقَّ they do not say (anything)
<lb/>concerning God except the truth.
<lb/>NOTE. Beside nouns, other expressions may follow the exceptive
<lb/>particle such as (i) an adverb, (ii) prepositional phrase,
<lb/>(iii) &hdot;âl, or (iv) clause known as maçdarîyaħ. Thus (i) مَا شَجَرَة
<lb/>في الجَنَّةِ إِلاَّ هُنَا there is no tree in the garden except here;
<lb/>(ii) إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِ اللهِ except by God's permission; (iii) إِلاَّ نَكَدًا
<lb/>except scantily, see §444 c, rem f, Note; and (iv) إِلاَّ أنْ الخ
<lb/>except that etc., see § 448 c.

<lb/>stand in the category of بَدَلُ البعضِ مِنَ الكُلِّ see Wright's Grammar, ii.

<lb/>We have treated conditional and conditional and hypothetical sentences
<lb/>in §§ 404 to 406, § 413 and § 417: it must now be explained that
<lb/>the apodosis of a conditional sentence commences with فَ (see
<lb/>§ 366 b) when the conditional particle (إِذَا or other) of
<lb/>the protasis cannot exercise any influence upon the apodosis, or
<lb/>is not required to do so.
<lb/>(a) This happens when the apodosis is a nominal sentence;
<lb/>thus مَهْمَا تَأْتِنَا بِهِ مِنْ آيَةٍ فَمَا نَحْنُ لَكَ بِمُؤمِنِينَ whatever
<lb/>sign thou bringest us, we do not believe thee; مَنْ يُوقَ شُحَّ
<lb/>نفسه فَأُلائِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ whosoever is made to guard against
<lb/>his own covetousness, those are the prosperous.
<lb/>(c) If the apodosis be a verbal sentence expressing command,
<lb/>prohibition or desire; thus إِنْ كُنتَ جِئْتَ بِآيَةٍ فَأْتِ بِهَا
<lb/>thou hast brought a sign, produce it.
<lb/>(d) If the apodosis be a verbal sentence preceded by سَ
<lb/>لَيْسَ ، لَنْ ، مَا ، قَدْ ، سَوْفَ thus إِنِ اسْتَقَرَّ مَكَانَهُ فَسَوْفَ تَرَانِي
<lb/>if it stand firm in its place. hereafter thou shalt see Me.
<lb/>REM. There are cases when the use of فَ is optional.
<lb/>588. The hypothetical particle لَو implies that what is
<lb/>supposed is, as a matter of fact, not true or at any rate is
<lb/>improbable (see § 404 a), whereas إِن simply indicates a
<lb/>condition.
<lb/>590. The affirmative particle لَ (see § 361 c) may be prefixed
<lb/>to the apodosis of a hypothetical sentence, thus لَوْ شَآءَ رَبُّك
<lb/>لَجَعلَ الناسَ أُمَةً وَاحِدَة if thy Lord had willed, He would have
<lb/>made (all) mankind one people.

<lb/>Arabic poetry during the so-called classical period,
<lb/>from about 500 to 750 A.D., always takes the form of short
<lb/>poems, which rarely exceed the length of a hundred and twenty
<lb/>verses. Such poems are named &kdot;a&sdo;tîaħs (قَصِيدَة plur. قَصَائِدُ);
<lb/>whereas a mere fragment, consisting of only a few verses, is
<lb/>termed a &kdot;i&tdot;aħ (قِطْعَة plur. قِطَع also مُقَطَّعَات).
<lb/>REM. Rhyme without metre or measure does not constitute poetry.
<lb/>592. Each verse or bayt (بَيْت plur. أَبْيَات) consist or two hemistichs.
<lb/>593. Rhyme (قَافِيَة) is of two kinds. When the verse ends
<lb/>with a consonant, the rhyme is called fettered (مُقَيَّدَة); when
<lb/>it ends with a vowel, loose (مُطْلَقَة).According to ancient rule,
<lb/>the two hemistichs of the first verse of a &kdot;a&sdot;îdaħ must rhyme
<lb/>with one another, and the same rhyme must be repeated at the
<lb/>end of every verse throughout the whole poem.
<lb/>594. The essential part of the rhyme is the letter called
<lb/>al rawî, اَلرَّوِيُّ which remains the same throughout the entire poem.
<lb/>REM. The letters و ا and ي cannot be employed as rawî
<lb/>when they are long vowels and in some other cases.
<lb/>595. The loose rhyme (see § 593) terminates in what is
<lb/>called اَلصِّلَةُ the annex or appendix to the rawî. The &sdot;laħ
<lb/>may be either one of the long vowels و ي ا or the
<lb/>letter ه preceded by one of the short vowels ُه ُه ُه
<pb n="218">
<lb/>REM. a. The final vowel of a verse is always long, because
<lb/>it is regarded as being following by the homogeneous letter of
<lb/>prolongation (see § 6), whether this latter be written or not.
<lb/>The vowel-letter ا is invariably expressed, but و and ي are often
<lb/>omitted, e.g. وَيَدِ for وَيَدِي and my hand, صَنَعُ for صَنَعُو or
<lb/>صَنَعُوا they made.
<lb/>598. The last two quiescent (§ 9, rem. a) letters of a verse
<lb/>form the limits between which is comprised the rhyme. Hence
<lb/>the Arab gammarians distinguish five varieties of rhyme,
<lb/>according to the number or moving (§ 4, rem. b) letters which
<lb/>come between the two quiescents.
<lb/>600 Every verse in Arabic poetry consists of a certain
<lb/>number of feet, and a certain collocation of feet constitutes a
<lb/>metre (بَحْر, plural أَبْحُر).
<lb/>601. The metres are ordinarily reckoned to be sixteen in number.
<lb/>NOTE. Thee following sections include only those metres of
<lb/>which examples occur in Wright's Arabic Reading -Book.
<lb/>603. Of the iambic metres we shall mention the rajaz,
<lb/>kâmil, and wâfir.
<lb/>604. It is a peculiarity of rajaz (اَلرَّجَزُ the trembling) that
<lb/>each hemistich usually forms, as it were, an independent verse
<lb/>and rhymes with the preceding one.
<lb/>Trimeter acatalecatic

<lb/>Dimeter actatlectic

<lb/>This last variety is sometime lengthened by the addition of a syllable

<lb/>in which case it is said to be مُرَفَّل having a train.
<lb/>607. The basic of the wâfir (اَلْوَافِرُ the exuberant) is the
<lb/>same as that of the kâmil, but with the order of the component
<lb/>pars reversed, [xxx]
<lb/>Trimeter

<lb/>609. Of the amphibrachic metres we shall mention the

<lb/>610. The basis of the muta&kdot;ârib (الْمُتَقَارِبُ the tripping)
<lb/>is [xxx] (amphibrachys), for which may be substituted [xxx]
<lb/>Tetrameter catalectic

<lb/>The last foot of the second hemistich may be changed into

<lb/>613. Of the anapaestic metres we shall mention the basî&tdot;
<lb/>and munsari&hdot;.
<lb/>615. The basî&tdot; (اَلْبَسِيطُ the outspread) is a favourite metre
<lb/>with the older poets.
<lb/>Tetrameter
<lb/>[xxx]
<lb/>616. The munsari&hdot; (اَلْمُنْسَرِحُ the flowing) has the same base
<lb/>as the basî&tdot;, but the first [xxx] is reduced to a single long syllable.
<lb/>Tetrameter
<lb/>[xxx]
<lb/>618. Of the ionic metres we shall mention the ramal, madîd, and khafîf.

<lb/>623. Something must now be said concerning the forms
<lb/>which the final syllables of words assume at the end of a verse.
<lb/>624. Final short vowels are either dropped or retained as
<lb/>long (see § 595, rem. a), the tanwîn of the noun disappearing at
<lb/>the same time; e. g. فَإِنَّ عُقُوقَ الْوَالِدَاتِ كَبِيرُ for verily disobedience
<lb/>to mothers is (a) great (sin), for خَلِيلُكَ مِنْ مُرَاد كَبِير
<lb/>thy friend of (the tribe) Murâd, for مُرَادٍ In this case final
<lb/>fat&hdot;aħ is always accompanied by an 'alif, as وَمَا يُغْنِي التَّمِيمَاتُ
<lb/>الْحِمَامَا and amulets do not avail against death, for الْحِمَامَ
<lb/><pb n="222">
<lb/>625. The accusative termination ً ا generally becomes َ ا
<lb/>thought it occasionally disappears altogether.
<lb/>626. The feminine terminations َ ةٍ َ ة and َ ةً become
<lb/>هْ more rarely تْ likewise ةُ and ةَ whether
<lb/>masculine or feminine.
<lb/>627. Nouns ending in ي or ا simkply drop the tanwîn;
<lb/>thus فَتًى a youth becomes فَتَى or فَتَا and عَصًا a staff عَصَا
<lb/>Those ending in ٍ drop the tanwîn and either resume the third
<lb/>radical or not, at pleasure; e.g. قَاضٍ a judge may become either قَاضْ or قَاضِي
<lb/>628. The long vowels ي ا and و usually remain unchanged.
<lb/>REM. B. The genitive and accusative suffixes of the first
<lb/>personal pronoun, ي and ني have several pausal forms,
<lb/>namely نيَا نِيَهْ يَا يَهْ
<lb/>REM. c. In rhyme the long vowels ي and و are often
<lb/>expressed merely by kasraħ and &ddot;ammaħ.
<lb/>629. When the penultimate letter of a word bears sukûn,
<lb/>the vowel of the final letter may be transferred to it in rhyme,
<lb/>e. g. الصَّدِرْ for الصَّدْرِ
<lb/>REM. a. This transference (نَقْل) is not allowed when it
<lb/>would rise to a form which has no example in the language.
<lb/>630. Indeclinable words ending in a vowel when used as
<pb n="223">
<lb/>rhymes take a final ة which is technically called هَاءُ الوَقْف the
<lb/>hâ of pause or هَاءُ السَّكْتِ the hâ of silence; thus كَيْفَ how
<lb/>becomes كَيْفَهْ The same letter is added to some verbal
<lb/>and pronominal forms (see § 628, rem. b).
<lb/>The concluding sections (232—253) of Wriht's Grammar
<lb/>illustrate the principal poetic licenses which affect the form of
<lb/>words used in verse. This subject does not fall within the scope
<lb/>of an elementary work; moreover, the slight changes which
<lb/>custom permits are seldom of such a nature as the cause any difficulty to the student.
